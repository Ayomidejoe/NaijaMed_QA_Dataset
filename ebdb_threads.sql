I would like to know if there is a rate at which it grows. Should I expect it to have doubled in size by the end of the year, for instance.

I would also like to know how high my chances of infertility or miscarriages.

Can I adopt any contraceptive method to slow its growth?

I am a 23-year-old and I may not be married until the next 2 years. Is this timeframe safe for me?

  I had this same experience last years and I was told to do an ECG and then 2d echo, both tests said I''m fine, they didn''t see anything. So when I had another episode this year I was told to do a CT scan, the scam also discovered nothing, it was a normal study. Th chest pain isn''t so serious anymore but it''s there, just mild.

Finding: There is mild straightening of the cervical spine with no obvious osteophytosis. The vertebral body heights, marrow and signal intensity are preserved. There is no abnormality noted in the disc.

The spinal cord appear normal in thickness and signal intensity. However a soft tissue mass with intensity consistent with that of measuring 3.1cmx2.1cm in size is noted at the level of C5 to C7  vertebrae probably a lipoma.

The adjacent facetal joint appear indistinct.

At C2/C3, C3/C4, C4/C5, C5/C6 and C6/C7 showed normal  disc hydration with an unremarkable ligamentum flavum  and neuroforamina however the loss of distinctiveness of the articulating bones of the facetal joint at the level of C5/C6 and C6/C7 is highly suspicious of early onset degenerative changes probably post traumatic.

However, It wasn''t till the third time we were intimate that my partner noticed blood on his condom. I hadn''t been particularly enjoying penetration so, we were happy to chalk it off to my thicker than normal hymen. But, then, A week later, we noticed some blood AGAIN! But then, no blood for the next two sessions. While that in itself is worrying, the more perplexing issue is that I am not enjoying the actual act of penetration at all. Once he gets in, I just feel sore and a lot of pressure like I am having cramps. I''ve tried to be on top but the pain becomes unbearable and he is unable to go all the way in. He says I''m moist enough so, lubrication isn''t the challenge. Neither is it insufficient foreplay. So far, we''ve had sex six times and I''m really fed up of not been able to have fun while we''re intimate.

I googled alot and it''s scared me how likely it could be cancer, about a few days before the breast burn I had a very small lump appear in the armpit on my opposite side, I noticed it when bathing and didn''t think much of it, it was a bit tender but as of today while still there it''s a lot less prominent as well as less tender so I''m not sure if that''s related.

Last week, I woke up from a short nap feeling very anxious, my heart rate was up and I had to try and calm down. I also had a lot of guess and felt pressure at my chest causing me to belch constantly. I calmed down soon after the incident and was able to sleep well later that night. Last I checked before I slept I had a bpm close to between 65 - 69

Yesterday evening a similar incident happened. I napped for a short while in the evening and woke up very anxious and with a fast heart rate. I tried calming down and had very bad tasting belches constantly. A lot more different than last time where it felt more like air bubbles, eventually I calmed down and was able to sleep but through most of today I''ve had a very watery stool. Went to the toilet 3 times but haven''t had any more need to since the mid afternoon. I checked my bpm and it''s between 75 and 80. I''m now worried and have been feeling very anxious all day (not in the same ways I woke up previously), and wondering if this is too high?
I feel a bit of heartburn which I hear is normal with acid reflux but besides that I don''t feel anything else. Is there something wrong with my heart and should I be doing anything to help?

Status wise I''m in my mid 20s, female, overweight but not obese, never had children. And the shutdown has left me very idle.

Is what I had acid reflux or something else, should I get some tests done? And if it is acid reflux how can I deal with it
And is my bpm too high? Should I do more exercise in the house or are there any other solutions I can take?

I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s paranoia but I still need to ask. Is it possible to experience loss of smell without noticing??. Is it also possible to have loss of smell without loss of taste??. Okay so I have chest pain and cough a while back but itâ€™s all cleared up now. Then I concluded in my mind that even if it was Covid as long as Iâ€™m fine now after 14days everything is okay but then I read an article yesterday about how Covid 19 can lead to brain complications and how the olfactory route can be a channel for the virus to get into the brain(Hyposmia). Then I started trying to track my days of being sick if I remember smelling, I remember smelling a lot of things but I canâ€™t remember which day I smelt this different things. It started on Sunday and I remember smelling somethings until Tuesday morning, I couldnâ€™t remember anything about Wednesday or Thursday but I remember smelling on Friday. I canâ€™t also remember for Saturday but I know I smelt on Sunday too, like that sha. So now my question is that is it possible for my loss of smell to be disappearing periodically within that 14 days . Also if your loss of smell is gone, it has to do with the nerves there right?? How long would it take for the smell to come back Naturally. I know I smelt a lot of things o and Iâ€™m itâ€™s very much possible I smelt on the days I canâ€™t remember too because I was eating well and I didnâ€™t experience loss of taste but Iâ€™m just scared. I remember washing my hand with soap a couple of times and I could smell it perfectly but I just donâ€™t know which days I did. 
Lastly, if the virus now finds it self to the brain, is it possible to have brain complications without noticing??. Is it also possible to have brain complications weeks after full recovery. I know my question is really long but Iâ€™m just really worried and Iâ€™ll appreciate a well detailed explanation/response.
