1,3,Mental Health,All of a sudden I have been having episodes of panic attacks who can help me understand the cause and how to prevent them,24,121,[en:0.9999963524833737],"First off it is completely natural to panic when you find yourself in a situation that is dangerous or stressful But if you find yourself panicking frequently for no apparent reason then you might be suffering from a panic disorder 

Panic attacks are sometimes triggered by certain memories or events in your life Other times they can happen spontaneously without any trigger So to understand the cause you need to try and remember if you had any specific thoughts or experienced certain things before your previous panic episodes occurred 

As for treatment firstly you need to understand that panic attacks are not life threatening meaning that you are not likely to die or be physically harmed from having a panic attack So relax 

The next time you have a panic attack do the following 

1 Stay where you are 
2 Breathe in and out deeply and slowly
3 Remind yourself that it is just another panic attack and it will be over in a few minutes 

Panic attacks usually resolve on their own within 5  20 minutes 

However if your panic attacks are so frequent that they prevent you from having a normal day at work or at home then you need to visit a psychologist The psychologist may ask you to perform some exercises on a regualr basis and may also prescribe some medications to help 

Overall you should be fine eventually",266,1325,[en:0.9999982513913231]

That said if you feel weak and you think it might be because you are short of blood Again you cannot know that for sure There are several other reasons that can explain the weakness youre feeling 

What you need to do is to see a doctor who will then ask you to explain your all symptoms in detail You may be asked to do some tests the doctor will explain the results to you and the doctor will let you know what to do afterwards depending on whether or not your blood turned out to be short Lol",131,630,[en:0.9999971365755083]

Id like to know if theres any such thing as a burst uterus and under what conditions such may occur",34,147,[en:0.9999980779345438],I guess you are talking about ruptured uterus and it is a rare event  The uterus is made up of a mass of muscles so depending on its state integrity and rate of contraction it could tear and this will be described as a rupture  It can also happen in uterus that have been breached before due to ceaserean section,66,312,[en:0.9999974370578848]

How big are these swellings

In the meantime ensure good hygiene to the area and do not itch scratch or attempt to burst the Swelling

1 No one can predict the rate at which they grow at times they regress on their own at times they maintain the same size due to different reasons 

2 Having fibroid is not equal to infertility except in a few cases so I would say that you technically have nothing to worry about with respect to infertility It also doesnt equal to having miscarriages it does cause it at times but its not a surety

3 If you are worried about the size or have any symptoms from it you can have it removed to give you rest if mind but asides that you dont have to worry or stress yourself about it

I consulted another physician who recommended antibiotics and that I should avoid extreme rigorous exercises such as weight lifting and these two resolved the whole pain so I agree with Dr Ayomide that cold and physical exercise could aggravate it I suspect my own case was mild pain to inflammation maybe caused by bacteria so that was why antibiotics was recommended for me

Truly sorry indeed to hear about this problem that youre having 
As you have reported this problem started 5 months into your marriage Perhaps an eventsituation happened at the time that caused you to become more anxious about sexual intercourse with your partner
If so it might be a worth while venture to openly and freely discuss with your spouse about this issue Communication break down between partners has been found to be a major player in unsatisfactory sexual intercourse among partners

Also rather than the penetrative intercourse itself you might want to consider spending a lot more time on foreplay if you have not tried this before Foreplay helps because it directs attention away from you to how better you can please your partner Do kindly ask her in what ways she would like you to please her

You might also want to consider seeing a specialist about this issue

According to Sigmund Freud there are different stages of sexual development which a human passes through

Can a lady get infected by spreading her underwear in the bathroom after washing the normal toilet and bathroom together",24,128,[en:0.9999980829898953],"Hi

I believe the real danger is not in the actual act of spreading the underwear provided the underwear is well clipped to prevent it from dropping to the floor in the bathroom The danger however minimal might lie in not letting the underwear properly dry before use

There might be some degree of discomfort in the use of damp underwear

Also infections as you probably know are caused by microorganisms and moisture is a growth promoting factor for microorganisms It is therefore perhaps not the best idea to use damp underwear

Wherever you choose to spread underwear just ensure that it is well dry before use",118,614,[en:0.9999974094469954]

There is no need to panic if you have had any unprotected sexual contact in the past few weeks you should go and run a pregnancy test There are home kits that are sold in pharmacies that you can use or you can go to a lab and do a blood test

Good morning 

There could be a lot of reasons why you have not seen your period 

Firstly you may be pregnant if you are sexually active so you might want to do a pregnancy test 

Stress is also known to be a cause of delayed periods so you may want to check if you are under any form of stress and adjust 

It could be a hormonal Too much fat or too little fat can cause absent menses 

It can be an infection going on

I think you might want to wait until the results of your tests are out for a conclusive diagnosis 

As regards your desire to get some weight loss it is quite important to understand that weight loss is primarily a function of the balance between calorie gain and calorie loss 

It would help if you watch your diet  reduce the carbohydrates engage more in exercises and more physical activity cut down processed foods and junk drink more water and less drinks stop late night eating and indulge more fruits 

i believe these should help you lose weight If you need more help you can contact a nutritionist you can reach out to Dr Chinasa Amadi on wwwariellafitnesscom

There are a lot of factors that could lead to repeated infections Abuse of antibiotics is one because it alters the delicate balance of vaginal flora and leads to infections 

Secondly you way want to consider vaginal hygiene if its adequate do not wipe from back to front do not douch wash your vagina with just water and mild soap

If AS and AS marry for each pregnancy theres a 25 chance of an SS baby 50 chance of an AS baby and 25 chance of an AA baby 
Sadly some couples have all their kids as AS while some have both AS SS and even AA
The truth is that predicting cant really be done asides invitro fertilization where the genetic make up of the zygote is checked before implantation into the uterus and the procedure is quite expensive
It is therefore advisable that AS and AS dont marry to save the parents the stress of ceaseless hospital admissions and save the child of countless crises and pains

Some people pick up some things from childhood and find it difficult to drop them such as biting nails or the case you mentioned
For your friend the first question is that is she willing to stop
If yes then you can check the triggers Does she do it when shes stressed happy or distracted
Once the triggers are identified then she can work towards doing other things to occupy her time during those moments She could use an alternative like using a handkerchief to clean her nose if she feels like poking it that way shes not likely to put the handky into her mouth thereafter
Also a strong support system will be useful So please dont condemn her when you catch her doing it You can just remind her to do it right and with time shes likely to overcome the habit

Truly sorry to hear about your complaint
Its important to note that as far as something being wrong with you is concerned the peculiarities of your living arrangement with your partner poses a problem in stating that definitively

Infertility is considered as the inability to become pregnant after regular well spread 23 times weekly unprotected sexual intercourse Importantly this must have gone on over a duration of a year

Unfortunately the living schedule with your partner makes that continuous over a year intercourse rather impossible

This might be hard but you and your partner will have to find a living arrangement that lets you spend a much more extended period of time together than that 1 month span 

You might also along with your partner visit a specialist where tests can be carried out on you both for the sake of being thorough with the approach to your situation

Kindly find a way to spend more time with your partner

Your history of masturbation might or might not be linked with your issues with ejaculating too early This happens to people who do not masturbate too
One of the things that can help is for you to discuss this with your partner
When you are having sex dont get too anxious about ejaculating early
Then when you feel you want to ejaculate let your partner press the tip of your penis together for a while till the urge goes away you can keep repeating this to last a bit longer it helps
You can also get creams in the pharmacy that can help prolong ejaculation 
Its important to note here that lasting for 3  5 minutes is really enough no need to kill yourself because of long duration

About not enjoying sex with your partner you should discuss this with her and let her know what helps you or makes it enjoyable for you

Sorry to hear about your complaint

As you have rightly pointed out masturbation can indeed affect your sexual performance through premature ejaculation

The best advice I can offer you is largely bahvioural which while may take some time to fully yield fruit has been shown to not only improve sexual performance but also your overall relationship with your partner

To start with keep in mind that sex must be enjoyed by both partners Penetrative intercourse tends to place more emphasis on your own pleasure so you must learn to prioritise foreplay Find out how your partner likes to be touched and in what new ways you can please her without penetrative sex

Even when you do have penetrative sex and you feel the urge to ejaculate reduce the intensity of your thrusts and relax This will require communication with your partner

Also the use of condoms can help as it reduces penile sensitivity There are also medications available in pharmacies

It is therefore important that you go to a hospital for proper follow up and please all your family members should be tested

Vaginitis is a term used to describe vaginal inflammation or infection characterised by itching foulsmelling discharge and sometimes pain Number of factors have been known to cause this and these include imbalance in vaginal normal flora bacterial infection and oestrogen depletion in post menopausal women
The vagina has its own resident microorganisms normal flora which perform protective roles in the vagina Once these organisms are depleted due to some unhealthy practices like douching washing inside of the vagina with soap usage of vaginal spray etcother harmful bacteria can then begin to multiply in the vagina leading to infection
These bacteria can also invade the vagina in cases relating to immunosuppression

Im sorry about the stress youve had so far with contraceptives
Hormonal contraceptives can cause weight gain and progesteroneonly implants are notorious for causing menstrual irregularities
If you use combined oral contraceptives your menstrual cycle will be regular but you may still gain weight Also note that you have to take the pills everyday at a regular time
You could also use a nonhormonal intrauterine contraceptive device like Copper IUCD which wont make you gain weight or cause menstrual irregularities but it may cause heavy menstrual flow
There are barrier methods that you could use too in form of female condom or cervical cap You could also use spermicidal creams
Kindly visit the family planning clinic for any of these options that will be suitable for you
I hope this is helpful

Folliculitis can be annoying to manage but its treatable Before commencing antibiotics its best to know what the cause is or if it appears anywhere else besides your scalp

1 Ensure that you wash the infected area with warm water and soap regularly Use clean towels if possible change them after 2 days or less
2 You can massage with warm saltwater 1 teaspoon table salt mixed with 2 cups of water
3 Limit your use of skin oils and other skin products change to milder soap 
4 Ensure a highly hygienic barbing protocol

If these dont improve your condition then you might have to see a doctor possibly a dermatologist to know if you truly have folliculitis its cause and be treated accordingly",175,814,[en:0.9999966884245819]

I will like to know how people catch Hepatitis what to do to avoid catching it",22,89,[en:0.9999962854100825],"Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver Viruses are the most common cause but other infections toxic substances eg alcohol certain drugs and autoimmune diseases can also cause it It can be selflimiting or can progress to fibrosis cirrhosis or liver cancer Many more people dont even know that they have hepatitis

There are 5 main hepatitis viruses referred to as types A B C D and E

A and E are typically caused by consumption of contaminated food or water 

B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and together are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer
B C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids Common ways of catching these viruses include receipt of contaminated blood or blood products invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment and for hepatitis B transmission from mother to baby at birth from family membersdomestic help to child and also by sexual contact

Acute infection may occur with limited or no symptoms or may include symptoms such as jaundice yellowing of the skin and eyes dark urine extreme fatigue nausea vomiting and abdominal pain

Treatment options are determined by which type of hepatitis you have and whether the infection is acute or chronic

WAYS TO PREVENT HEPATITIS
1 Practicing good hygiene especially with how you prepare what you eat and drink or get them from 

2 Hepatitis B C and D contracted through contaminated blood can be prevented by not sharing needles razors someone elses toothbrush not touching spilled blood 
Hepatitis B and C can also be contracted through sexual intercourse and intimate sexual contact Practicing safe sex by using condoms and dental dams can help decrease the risk of infection

3 Vaccinations are available to prevent the development of hepatitis A and B",365,1819,[en:0.9999960618737491]

If your baby is breastfeeding you might want to make she he or she latches on the breast properly to avoid him her sucking in air alongside the breast milk

if these dont work you can see a doctor who may prescribe gas drops according to the age of your baby

I do not completely understand your question However I will use this opportunity to talk about STIs and I hope I address your concern 

Sexually transmitted infections STIs are infections that can be caught or passed on when you have UNPROTECTED sex or close sexual contact with another person who already has an STI
Using a condom during sex is the best way to avoid STIs including HIV if you cannot abstain 
Also reducing the number of sexual partners also means youre less likely to get infected

If you suspect you have an STIs please go and see a doctor because symptoms vary from person to person and if you have been diagnosed with an STI let your sexual partners know and encourage them to get tested and treated too 

There are many different STIs and there are many signs and symptoms that mean you may have gotten one but sometimes there are no signs at all When STIs do produce symptoms they usually develop around the penis or vagina Your sexual partners may also experience symptoms

Generally the symptoms of STIs can include 
 unusual andor smelly discharge from the penis vagina or anus
 pain during urination
 sores blisters ulcers warts or rashes in the genital area
 pain in the scrotum or testicles
 lumps and bumps on the genitals

You can visit a General Hospital around you for check up and treatment",286,1337,[en:0.9999962391029515]

Im glad you already know that nutrition as well as lifting weights play significant and complimentary roles in bulking and gaining muscle mass

Foods to eat more of 
Beans rice moinmoin swallows such as eba amala and co are usually good during the bulking season Oatmeal makes really great breakfast 
Bread cereal crackers popcorn fruits oranges apples bananas grapes pears watermelon Potatoes yams corn green peas Vegetables and nuts too 

You should limit alcohol and processed sugars or deep fried foods 

You might also consider supplements such as whey protein creatine and caffeine which decreases fatigue and allows you to work harder 

Speak to your trainer and the gym and do some research too There are a lot of Instagram accounts that document their journeys and provide answers to questions like these you should check them out too

Sounds like a case of easy exhaustion  which can be due to a number of things such as anaemia mental health disorders and chronic fatigue syndrome which can only be diagnosed after all the other causes have been ruled out

What other symptoms do you have Whats your eating habits and nutrition like Any kind of stressors Are you male or female Are there issues with your ability to concentrate or pay attention What about short term memory Are there associated body pains or tenderness Where you ill before you started feeling constantly fatigued 

Finding the underlying cause will require ruling out a number of causes until the reason is identified or ruled out and this means a number of tests However the doctor has to rule out anaemia check out your thyroid liver and kidney functions etc 

Following the results of those tests the doctor will be able to know the line of action to take
Meanwhile try to reduce physical and emotional stress you can start yoga if possible and gradual exercise programs with a physiotherapist will also help with the back pain 
The doctor might also refer you to a behavioural therapist if no exact cause is found

My advice is that you avoid popping picking at or touching them as popping may cause scarring In addition touching your pimple can transfer oil and bacteria from your hands to your face therefore infecting the pimple and not giving it a chance to heal

Washing your face regularly about twice per day especially when it gets sweaty This helps to keep oil from building up and clogging your pores Dont overwash or use harsh scrubs Acne is not caused by dirt Two gentle washings a day is enough Too much cleaning can leave skin irritated and dry triggering glands to produce more oil increasing the likelihood of pimples

Stress or hormonal changes can also worsen pimples outbreak 

Cosmetics and makeup that have a greasy consistency may also clog pores Waterbased products are less likely to cause pimples than oilbased makeup Use oilfree or noncomedogenic products those that wont clog pores on your face

Without the knowledge of your wifes medical and obstetrics history it is hard to say why an operation  cesarean section has been advised However when it is advised by your doctor a CS is usually a safer option for the mother and the baby than a vaginal delivery My advise is that you speak to the doctor who can allay your fears by explaining the exact reasons for a CS 

Some indications for a planned CS include but are not limited to the following 
1 When your babybabies are in an abnormal position or if the mother carrying more than one baby a CS is often the safest way to deliver them without dangerous complications 
2 If theres a problem with the mothers placenta If the placenta is covering all or part of the opening of the mothers cervix a CS is highly recommended for delivery
3 In cases of prolapsed umbilical cord that is when a part of umbilical cord slips through your cervix before of your baby is another indication for a CS 
4 If the physical health of the mother is a concern conditions such as a heart or brain disorders might make the doctor request a CS
5 If theres a mechanical obstruction obstructing the birth canal or if your baby has a really large size or head 
6 A previous CS although not absolute is also an indication for a CS  

As you can see there are multiple reasons for a CS this is not all and a doctor has to ensure that all of these do not lead to dangerous outcomes for your wife or child during delivery 

Please note that any attempt to forcefully go against such advice of a doctor is dangerous and can lead to unfavourable outcomes such as rupture of the womb leading to its complete removal or death 

If still uncomfortable with the doctors request you can seek another opinion with a specialist obstetrician

Theres no point living in fear of something that you have control over so long as you completed your dosage and are taking precautions then I believe you should not have to worry about that 

However here are some precautions to take to  reduce your chances of a reoccurrence of pelvic inflammatory disease 

1 Practice safe sex Use condoms every time you have sex limit your number of partners and always ask about a potential partners sexual history
2 Get regularly tested for STIs If youre at risk of an STI such as chlamydia make an appointment with your doctor for testing Set up a regular screening schedule with your doctor if needed Early treatment of an STI gives you the best chance of avoiding PID
3 Request that your partner be tested If you have pelvic inflammatory disease or an STI advise your partner to be tested and if necessary treated This can prevent the spread of STIs and possible recurrence of PID
4 Dont douche Douching upsets the balance of protective bacteria in your vagina
5 Temporary abstinence Avoid sexual intercourse until treatment is completed and tests indicate that the infection has cleared in all partners

1 Handwashing is one of the most important ways to reduce the spread of viral and bacterial infections that may lead to different infections 
2 Keeping the immune system strong by getting enough rest eating a wellbalanced diet and getting regular exercise can also decrease a persons chances of developing an infection
3 Covering the nose and mouth when coughing and limiting close contact with others until their symptoms have cleared up will also help prevent the infection spreading

Good evening Sorry about your experience 

Having sex for the first time is actually painful for the female   This is usually due to the hymen which is broken and may bleed during intercourse It usually gets better with time and the pain is less 

Another cause of painful intercourse is when the lady is not well lubricated hence the need for adequate foreplay and arousal before penetration 

again you might want to get rid of any negative thoughts you have about sex becaue if you keep having them it will always be painful most of the time 

make sure you have protected sex with condoms to avoid issues like unwanted pregnancies HIV hepatitis B and C 

I hope this helps

Thanks for your question Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV you must understand does not have any characteristic symptoms that define it The virus essentially weakens the bodys immune system causing a variety of manifestations which are also commonly seen in different other conditions Even after an initial period of symptoms such as fever sore throat muscle pain an infected person may show no other symptoms This does not mean that the person is now better The virus is simply quietly further taking over the body Eventually HIV if untreated will become AIDS which has even more severe rather nonspecific symptoms

As the old saying goes AIDS no dey show for face Proper treatment with existing HIV medication will prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS and will enable an individual live a practically normal life

If you suspect that you may have been exposed to the virus at some kindly do not hesitate to get tested HIV is not a death sentence

On further progress of the disease the person may have a prolonged cough whitish sores in the mouth and become really sick because the virus has weakened the bodys immune system These are just few of the many symptoms of HIV infection

Please note that a normal amount of menstrual flow per period can be anywhere between 5 ml and  80 ml 

Periods flow for the most part dont change after your first few monthsyears however they can changes in flow size or cycle length causing temporarily absent periods scantier flow or longer menstrual periods etc depending on your hormones Your hormones can fluctuate because of things like stress exercise diet or medication including contraceptives and strong antibiotics 
Periods can also fluctuate because of certain health conditions like infection uterine polyps fibroids or PCOS 

So I advised that you be patient let your body recover and it is expected that your normal flow will return over the next few months

It is true that some viral or fungal infections of the skin can cause generalised itching with or without rashes after a shower

374,11,Sexual Health,What can I do to improve my weak erection,9,41,[en:0.9999948071732956],"Hello there and thanks for your question

By weak erections I suppose you mean inability to sustain an erection

The reasons vary and could be due to some factors like age body size or body mass index BMI disease lifestyle mental state to name a few

The strength of erections normally decreases after 50 years some say later than this However in younger men this could happen once in a while and should not be a concern except when its becoming too frequent If the frequency is increased regardless of age you should see a doctor to do a proper assessment of what could be the possible cause

Your body size may also influence your erection Being overweight or obese puts you at risk of erectile dysfunction Obesity also hampers your enjoyment of the intercourse process which could affect your esteem and mental state So its important to embark on a weight loss program and exercise often Obesity also puts you at risk of diseases like diabetes and hypertension which can affect your erection

Diseases too like the ones mentioned above diabetes and hypertension and others like prostate disorders could lead to erectile dysfunction A history of trauma to the penis or scrotum deformities in the penis etc are also possible factors Again a full assessment by your doctor could identify this

Are you in a sound state of mind Are you depressed Are you anxious and over worrying Especially with young men this could influence your erections Having a relaxed and worry free mind can improve this condition

If this tends to occur during intercourse are you indulging in foreplay with your partner Taking it slow allows for the urge to heighten and the blood flow to the penis to increase Enjoy the process of intercourse and dont rush it Talk with your partner if there are any insecurities This can boost the attraction between you two and make the process enjoyable

Exercise always as this boosts the production of sexual hormones

Hope this helps",372,1949,[en:0.9999972206155848]

The best way to confirm the paternity of the fetus is through a DNA paternity test This can be done during or after the pregnancy as soon as the baby is born

There are a few centers who perform the prenatal DNA tests but these come with an increased risk of miscarriages but can be done as early as during the first trimester

Otherwise a sample can be obtained from the baby mother and alleged father as soon as delivery and analysed

Sorry to hear about your eye trouble

Itchy eyes could be possibly due to dry eyes allergies or perhaps an infection The infection might most likely be associated with a discharge so if your eyes have no discharge then it just might not be an infection

However short term measures you can take include immersing a piece of clean cloth perhaps a new napkin and soaking in cold water Close your eyes and place the  cold napkin over your eyes It should help with the itching

Besides that you could also visit a trusted pharmacy and request for an eye drop that could help with your itching

If this itching becomes persistent please kindly visit an ophthalmologist ie an eye doctor

I would also advise that you resist the urge to keep scratching the eyes as it might further worsen things

How long is your period usually How old are you Are you on contraceptives emergency or otherwise What is your weight Do you have any medical conditions Has this happened before 

However considering you have had your period again then I believe we can just write this off as a late period 
A healthy menstrual cycle can range from every 21 to 35 days

Having one or two irregular cycles a year is nothing abnormal It can be caused by hormonal imbalance and high stress usually seen during an illness travel emotional stress etc as this throws your cycle off 

If all things are normal it is expected that your period will return to whatever your normal duration was

You have stated just a dosage and no name of the pill however I will go ahead and assume it is a particular pill because of the reason it was taken This pill you might have taken is a very dangerous drug to take without a health workers supervision 
This is a prescription drug and without a prescription you COULD have also purchase a substandard drug 

However lets assume you took the right pill and of good quality the best way to confirm loss of pregnancy after an abortive attempt is to do a repeat pregnancy test in 4 weeks only then can you confirm a pregnancy loss Ultrasound scans on the other hand can reveal presence or absence earlier  

Going forward kindly consider longer term contraceptives speak to a Family Planning nurse about your options

The timing of the month the discharge occurs as well as any other symptoms in this case itching can help to identify the underlying cause

Are you sexually active Does your partner have any symptoms  

On account of the associated vaginal itching I think you might have an STI sexually transmitted infection Other symptoms may include bleeding with sexual intercourse painful urination discomfort in your pelvic region and spotting between periods 

Without treatment STIs can spread to the reproductive organs resulting in Pelvic Inflammatory Disease PID and if left untreated PID can result in chronic pelvic pain and infertility

Therefore my advice is that you visit a doctor who will examine you request for some tests including high vaginal swab mcs and based on the result and other symptoms present will provide an ACCURATE diagnosis and a  treatment regimen

To answer your question I believe that the reference to pregnancy is to indicate a certain level of sexual activity if I am not mistaken

While the HPV vaccine is generally recommended to have been administered at around the ages of 1112 please note that one could still benefit from the vaccine as it can confer protection against other strains of the virus even if one already is infected with a particular strain 
So yes it is still beneficial for someone who already has given birth

Another method we use to prevent transmission is for the husband to wear a condom that the tip has been cut off so that when he ejaculates the sperm goes into the woman 

I will advice overall that you intimate your managing doctor of your plan he will be in the best position to guide you along these

While what youve described erectile dysfunction is seen more commonly as men get older it also can be an indication of one or two illnesses

There is a need to check you blood sugar as diabetes is a rather common cause and can have no other symptoms

In your case I think your ED is more of a psychological one than physical It appears you are unable to become sexually excited by your wife as seen by your ability to maintain an erection with your girlfriend 

Please note that there are medications that can help you to maintain erections longer but first you must undergo a general physical test and be certified fit before such medications can be prescribed You can also choose to speak to a sexual therapist who might be able to find the underlying cause for your selective ED

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder falls under a category of mental illnesses called neurotic disorders

Like other mental health conditions there are a set of criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of OCD can be made Please note that OCD unlike its potrayal in social media does not refer to someone who takes hygeine seriously It is a highly distressing condition with serious life implications for an affected person 

Due to this anyone seeking to determine if they actually have this condition must visit a specialist psychiatrist who will be in a better position to make this diagnosis and offer a solution that will range from behavioural modification to drug therapy

Sorry to hear about the distress you are having in relation to your sexual life

Its important to understand that the path to curbing a hyperactive sexual life that causes considerable distress to daily living is one that cannot be resolved in a single day

Due to its importance there are a set of doctors trained to be able to cater to excessive or inadequate sexual desires which may be due to psychological or medical reasons

I would advise then that you kindly visit a specialist psychiatrist who will be able to assess you on both the pyschological and medical front in order to help you

Thanks for contacting Wellvis

Growth of molars is usually age dependent and are usually the last teeth as you may know The growth tends to be slower than your other type of teeth 

Pain usually comes because its pushing through the overlying gum till it reaches its final position This can be very discomforting especially when chewing I will recommend consuming softer foods so you do not have to exert a lot of force while chewing 

Pain killers can be taken to relieve any pain 

Mouth hygiene is important too You may want to use antisepticantibacterial mouthwash and avoid the toothbrush on that area as it grows 

But if the pain is unbearable youre bleeding from that area you develop a foul odour in your mouth kindly visit your local dentist for a specialist checkup

Sorry to hear about your distress

Its important to know that disruptions to the menstrual cycle may be caused by a number of reasons besides pregnancy Often overlooked factors such as changes in diet and stress may be responsible for delayed cycles

However because the menstrual cycle is regulated by a number of chemicals called hormones within the body system it is too much of a reach to attempt to pin point a cause without proper laboratory testing

Therefore please kindly visit a Specialist Gynaecologist who will examine you and then ask you to do some tests following which an appropriate course of treatment may then be determined

Please do not worry Kindly follow the above

I suppose youre referring to the mild bleeding that occurs when the fertilised ovum implants on the uterus following a few days after sexual intercourse

While some facts may be difficult to recall there are some subtle hints that can be a pointer to what kind of bleeding it was Among these are the colour and volume of the blood You are most likely aware of the color of your period blood by now Implantation bleeding is usually of a lighter shade of red usually mostly spotting and barely continuous for as long as period bleeding Another important factor is whether or not this bleeding happened around the time you are supposed to menstruate If it did it might not be implantation bleeding

More importantly however please purchase a pregnancy test kit at a pharmacy near you to be sure

I would also advise the use of protection in the future particularly to avoid the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases

Good afternoon 

Your worry is genuine but I want to reassure you that you are fine typically  we start worrying when its after 12 months and there has been regular unprotected sexual intercourse between couples 

However there are some conditions that you need to meet to take in 

You need to have regular sexual intercourse at least three times a week you need to have an idea of when you are ovulating to maximize the chances of getting pregnant 

Typically signs of ovulation include having breat tenderness and nipples get a bit sensitive ovulation pain increase in basal body temperature you can make use of the regular ovulation prediction kits 

After intercourse do not be quick to get up from the bed as to allow the sperms find their way up the genital tract 

you may want to also take preconceptional folic acid daily do more fruits alongside your husband

Seizures can be caused by many things ranging from infections issues in your cardiovascular system and even your metabolism to name a few To be able to know the cause your doctor will be interested in some information like your mums age onset of the seizures 8 years in her case duration of seizures how long does an episode last what kind of seizures one part of her body or the whole body shaking does anything happen before during or after the seizure any family history of seizures is she on any medication does she consume alcohol does it interfere with her life which does in most cases are there any other symptoms These are just a few of the many details needed to narrow down to a possible cause

If she has never had it up till only 8 years ago studies suggest that adults who develop seizures for the first time in adulthood may have a stroke and in some cases the cause is unknown 

She may benefit from long term anticonvulsants But these are not to be selfprescribed or selfadministered I will recommend seeking the consult of a neurologist a doctor specialized in the human nervous system You may be asked to repeat the brain scans since it has been over 5 years now and there is a possibility for any issues which were hidden before in the brain to be seen now This could be because it may have become more visible to the imaging device or maybe there has been an upgrade of the machine or possibly better expertise in viewing the scan

In the interim continue the good job of paying attention to her while together and continue giving her support Please remember not to put anything in her mouth while she is seizing and limiteliminate alcohol intake if any Taking a video while she has an episode to show your doctor may also be of benefit in making a diagnosis

Itching of the eye could be an indication of allergy irritation infection etc
 It could be associated with redness of the affected eye excessive tearing and discharge of pus in the case of infections
 Though it is common practice to self medicate it is not advisable to Visiting a clinic could help distinguish what is the possible cause Why you may ask Sometimes all you may need is just an antihistamine for an allergy and yet you may be using an antibiotic like the case of allergic conjuctivits and bacterial conjunctivitis
 Provided there is clarity on the cause of the itching the drug may not be right for you Especially in the case of an infectious cause the organism responsible may not be sensitive to the eye drops you are using
 On the issue of drugs some people do not know their sensitivities to different drugs As such you are just adding more fuel to the flame
 For the case of those whose itching may be an allergy it is advisable to avoid what causes the allergy
 Do not scratch the eye as this worsens the itching sensation

My recommendation will be to have your eyes checked at an eye clinic if that has not been done yet before considering what to use next Washing the eyes with clean water may be of benefit and wear sunglasses if the light is also an issue as well as to serve as a barrier for any irritants in the environment like smoke and dust

External hemorrhoids are much more common with symptoms such as irritation and pain itchy or burning sensation around the anus difficulty sitting down painful bowel movements blood appearing on toilet tissue after wiping 

Managing haemorrhoids often requires significant lifestyle changes this helps to reduce the severity of the symptoms These include

1 Drinking plenty of liquids and eating fiberrich diet keeps stool soft and easy to pass thus reducing irritation to the haemorrhoids during bowel movements Fruits veggies beans cereal etc are useful allies 
2 Avoid straining and pushing this worsens and exacerbates haemorrhoids Do not use harsh toilet paper preferably use water or wet wipes specific for haemorrhoids Try to get into a routine where you go at the same time every day
3 Consider painkillers like Ibuprofen to help with soreness Aspirin should be avoided as it can thin the blood and make bleeding worse
4 Take warm baths or sit in a bathtub filled with warm water for about 15 minutes especially after bowel movement Do not scrub or wash with irritating soaps
5 Topical creams for haemorrhoids with witch hazel can soothe pain however be careful of creams with hydrocortisone due to the side effect of prolonged use not more that 1 week is advised 
6 Ice packs can dull pain and bring down the swelling 
7 Wear loose soft underwear to keep the area aired out and stops moisture from building up to prevent irritation

1 Try to eat a lot of vegetables foods  fruits with high fibre content eg Apple wheat etc They aid digestion and will make your stooling much easier
2 Dont force your stools out when you go to defecate Drinking water lots hours before you go to the toilet will help to soften the stools
3 There are suppositories that will help ease the pain and aid the healing 
4 Avoid high fat foods and junks they digest slowly and will make your stools difficult to expel
5 Dont keep stools in for too long the longer they get the harder they become

Cotton buds most times seem harmless however there have been many cases of significant long term damage from their use in cleaning the ears Damages such as punctured eardrums to impacted wax etc have been reported 

Earwax is actually a good thing it lubricates the ear canals to keep them functioning properly keeps insects from crawling inside our ears and prevents microbes from growing around our ear drums There is no medical need for the use of ear buds in cleaning the ears as wax is naturally removed by our ears themselves
However if you feel like theres too much wax in your ears put in 2 or 3 drops of olive oil this softens the wax and works its way out",142,677,[en:0.9999970911383319]

Heaviness of the breast could be as a result of hormonal changes Except if it is a new occurrence and it is not associated with your period then there might be a need to clear your doubts

Nausea and pain in the upper part of your abdomen are not specific symptoms as they could be seen in many illnesses 

I would suggest you wait for your period since it is very close as you mentioned and if there is any form of delay you can then consult a gynaecologist

Trimethylaminuria is a metabolic disorder cause by the inability of the body to break down trimethylamine 
Trimethylamine has a fishy odor and is produced in the intestines when certain types of food ie eggs liver legumes fish and some vegetables are digested When it cant be broken down this leads to an accumulation in the body causing it to be excreted via the sweat urine and breath giving them  a characteristic fishy odor of trimethylaminuria

An attempt at diagnosis usually starts with the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms followed by urine test to check the amount of trimethylamine in the urine and genetic testing which are used to confirm the diagnosis

A blighted ovum is what occurs when an implanted fertilised egg in the uterus fails to develop into an embryo What this means is that although theres a positive pregnancy test and other parts of the egg may have formed the gestational sac remains empty 

Unfortunately theres no growing baby

The hormone that signals pregnancy is still usually being released and this can be read during pregnancy as a viable pregnancy however an obstetric scan will reveal the true status of the pregnancy

The first thing is to control the sugar level through medications under the supervision of a medical doctor with regular check ups 

Secondly please do not clean the wound with dextrose saline the problem is that there is high amount of sugar in the system which is making it difficult for the wound to heal cleaning with dextrose saline is basically adding more sugar to the wound 

My advise is that you visit a doctor who would request some tests and help to control the sugar level and while that is ongoing a qualified nurse will help you to dress the wound Wound dressing will initially be on a daily basis and as it begins to heal you might be required to come for dressing on alternate days and subsequently less frequently

Penile discharge thats neither urine nor semen requires medical attention It is a common symptom of many STDs and can also be caused by other things 

Considering it happens while erect ie sexually aroused its possible it is preejaculate AKA precum a clear fluid secreted during the early period of sexual activity however my advise is to see a physician who will rule out other causes and provide adequate treatment

Good evening 

I want to assume that this is your first pregnancy 
Having severe cramps at night may not be a good sign 

However it will be good to know if there are any assoicated issues like bleeding from your priavte part or a fever  or painful urination 

Having a urinary tract infection can cause that for you and if not addressed could lead to a miscarrige 

It will also be nice to note that you should also take a lot of water as dehydration can also give you this picture 

I advise you go to a hospital and see a doctor for proper evaluation including tests like urinalysis and others to ascertain that there is no infection going on

Good evening Adeloye 

Sorry to read about your worry 

so basically there are a few more pertinent questions 
How long has this pain been there
Are you diabetic
Are you hypertensive
What kind of job do you do Lifting heavy objects
Any chest pain

The list is actually endless 

For all its worth the pain could be from a nerve compression which could arise from poor sleeping position or some of trauma 

There is also the possibility of having an angina which actually originates from the heart and indicative of heart disease or the blood vessels around the heart 

This usually manifests as pain in the left hand that may be followed by chest pain some times 

Since you are in your forties i suggest you see a doctor asap You might also want to consider doing a comprehensive medical examination 

For the mean time you can take some analgesics to ease the pain

Injuries such as the one that you had usually require patience in the rehabilitation phase Im not entirely sure of the extent of the injury or what conversations you may have had with your doctor about the care of your finger post cast removal but I will advice patience

Usually when a cast is removed it is not unusual to experience certains things such as pain swelling and in this case stiffness of the joints involved and sometimes muscle atrophy This can last a few days to weeks depending on how long the cast was on for and what you have started doing since removal of the cast 

As this is normal it is important that a repeat xray is done to ensure a correct fusion of the bones followed by some medications if indicated and most importantly physiotherapy

Physiotherapy is the best way to improve the strength and flexibility of your fingers and help you return to activity within a few weeks
A physiotherapist will design a range of techniques that suits your needs and in most cases will ensure you can do the exercises at home These exercises are important to ensure you give yourself the best chance of a full recovery

Good morning 

Just give it some time and soon you will be able to fold into a fist The thing is this that joint had been placed in one position for a long time and it would take some time for you to be able to regain full mobility of the joint

Have you been able to ascertain the reason for the irregularities in your menstrual flow 
Speaking to a gynaecologist will be useful in understanding the reasonscauses and how to regulate it if possible

The term brain infection doesnt really convey a specific message 
A full medical report containing birth and labour details physical examination details medical history findings on investigations and tests etc of the child is required to make a statement on recovery and the possibility of being a normal baby 

My advise is to ask the doctor who diagnosed brain infection to give you details a full and complete medical diagnosis of the child and if necessary write down questions that you may have and request that answers are provided to you before leaving the hospital It is your right to know

This isnt really a question so its hard to respond accordingly 

However it is possible to have light bleeding while being pregnant this can be mistaken as menstruation sometimes 

There are no definitive symptoms of pregnancy therefore the only way to know if you are still pregnant or not is to do a pregnancy test either with a home kit pregnancy test that you can buy from a pharmacy or at a medical lab

Good morning 

The only symptom you described is just sweating it would be nice if you can let us know if there are any other associated symptoms 

That being said it seems to be that you may be suffering from a medical condition called hyperhidrosis which could be primary 

Another likely possibility is that you probably may have an over active throid  hyperthyroidism 

I suggest you see an endocrinologist who will examine you properly and would also need to carry out some investigations including a thyroid function test

There are things to use to reduce the sweating but to the best of my knowledge they are usually under prescription 

I hope this helps

Women have two ovaries in most cases except stated otherwise the ovaries release eggs which are fertilised by sperm cells to form a baby When one is removed the other can still release eggs for fertilisation 

However when the eggs are fertilised they are implanted on the inner walls of the uteruswomb which is where it then develops into an embryo and becomes a baby Therefore when theres no uterus it is impossible to the eggs to be implanted and cant develop into a baby

Good evening 

When you say last for hours what exactly do you mean

The average time  for penetrative sex is between 3 to 7 minutes excluding foreplay when you add foreplay  the time significantly increases foreplay includes kissing fondling and smooching before the act itself 

You dont sound as if you have any form of erectile dysfunction or inability to get your penis up or inability to have penetrative sex 

I dont know what the problem is but you should probably see a doctor or sex therapist for a detailed discussion 

If you feel that you are not pleasing your partner it would help to talk things over to know what works best for her rather than looking for perfomance enhancing medications 

I hope this helps

There is really no cause for alarm You can reassure your wife please Labour will come 

Typically some pregnancies may last this long without any sign of labour while some may have put to bed ny now it is good to note that each pregnancy differs 

She still has time up to 40 weeks or even 41 weeks All she needs is close monitoring she should continue with her antenatal visits 

Then she should also be watchful about the baby and the movements If at any point in time she feesl the baby is not moving as he or she used to kindly report to your doctor immediately 

She can walk around more often and yes sex can help as the sperm contains substances which can cause uterine contrations 

That being said both of you should not be anxious The labour will come in due time

Having unprotected sex is a risk factor to sexually transmitted diseases 

Although there are multiple conditions that can cause a rash on and around the penis including something as simple as an irritation to certain soaps or something more serious like an infection caused by fungus an STD or pubic lice

Sometimes its normal to have a gummy ie sticky vaginal discharge somewhere in between clear coloured to whitish This is the bodys way of keeping the vagina moist and clean and the consistency of the discharge is dependent on what time of the month it is eg around the time of ovulation the discharge tends to be clearer and less sticky 

Do you have other symptoms such as itching or pain while urinating 

However it should never have an unpleasant odor therefore theres a very high chance that you have an infection The fishy smell is a telltale of a vaginal infection 

My advice is that you visit a physician who will examine you and possibly request some lab investigations before placing you on some medication to treat you You should also request for a pregnancy test to confirm or allay your fear of pregnancy 

Ensure that you use protection for sex use a condom 

Also women tend to be more prone to UTIs from sex than men do therefore 
 try to urinate before sex and promptly after
 wash your genital and anal areas before and after sex and 
 stay hydrated and drink plenty of water

For many women pregnancyrelated lower back pain starts within the first trimester In most cases this is expected due to the fact that as the pregnancy progresses the womans posture changes and as the weight of the baby increases in front it pulls on your back creating a shift in balance and puts a strain on the back
Also method of sleeping is often a factor she should try laying on her side and try to be more comfortable
Release of some hormones during pregnancy may also cause the ligaments of the lower back to soften as pregnancy progresses 

Pregnancyrelated lower back pain can be relieved or reduced by the following 
1 By maintaining good posture while seating or standing also avoid standing for long periods of time
2 By squatting instead of bending at the waist when she wants to pick something from the floor Avoid lifting heavy things 
3 While in bed try sleeping on the side with pillows tucked beneath your belly and between your knees for gentle support
4 Practice pregnancysafe exercises designed to strengthen and support your abdomen and back
5 When seated try to elevate your feet and make sure your chair offers good back support Use a lumbar pillow for additional low back support
6 Try to get plenty of rest
7 Discuss these with your physician during your ANC visits

Vaginal or vulva itching can be caused by irritants skin disorders infections or menopause

Exposing the vagina to irritants such as feminine sprays douches topical creams ointments etc can trigger an allergic reaction that creates an itchy rash over various areas of the body including the vagina

Some skin diseases such as eczema and psoriasis can cause redness and itching in the genital region

Vaginal yeast infection a very common condition alongside some STDs can also cause itching Yeast infection often occurs after taking a course of antibiotics which tend to destroy good bacteria needed to keep yeast growth in check

Sorry about your symptoms Can I know how old you are Menses could be irregular during the first or last years of having a period

When you say always have irregularity how far back do you mean and could you kindly explain in terms of how many days your flow lasts and after it stops how long does it take to come back  Months Years As mentioned above age is important but remember if your period returns within 2135 days it is normal And if your bleeding lasts 37 days that is normal too In some people the normal is outside these ranges

With regards the brownish discharge when did that start happening Does it have a bad smell or no smell Are you sexually active These could point towards an infection
 What kind of bathroom do you use What material is your underwear made of Do you douche that is clean the inside of your vagina with soap or similar Shared bathrooms and unhygienic toilets put women are risk of infections too Wearing nylon underwear also promotes the growth of bad organisms Douching is a very harmful practice which kills the beneficial organisms in a womans vagina

If you could please provide answers to some of these it may benefit usso that we give you the best advice we can

If by that time you have not seen it consider doing a pregnancy test However note that it is common for the period to be delayed from stress like worrying So I urge you not to panic and follow Dr Adeosuns advice

Remember to use protection if youre not in a committed relationship and in the event you choose not indulge in barrier contraceptives there are other methods which are available But you always want to keep yourself safe as women are more prone to infection including the HPV Human Papilloma Virus which causes cervical cancer than men

It is possible that you might have had an incomplete miscarriage 
In situations like this the scan will show an empty uterus with no signs of pregnancy but the urineblood tests will still be positive for a few days after 
Pregnancy tests detect the presence of the pregnancy hormone hCG however after a miscarriage occurs the hormone does not disappear from a womans body right away instead the level of hCG gradually decreases falling back down to an undetectable level over a period of days or even weeks depending on how far along the pregnancy was when the miscarriage happened

With an incomplete miscarriage there is still pregnancy tissue leftover in the uterus but unfortunately it does not mean that the pregnancy is continuing or is viable Symptoms are complaints of passage of clots or pieces of tissue plus vaginal bleeding with associated cramps

A  simple medical procedure might be required to remove the retained products of conception which is usually only small pieces of the placenta These tissues will probably be reabsorbed broken down by your body in time but the procedure can help put a stop to heavy bleeding sooner as bleeding is a common symptom of an incomplete miscarriage

Vaginal yeast infections may present with the following symptoms vaginal itch with a classic a thick discharge cottage cheese consistency a burning discomfort around the vaginal opening especially if urine touches the area and pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse 

Because these symptoms are similar to many other vaginal infections which are treated with different types of medicines it is in your best interest to speak to a doctor who can tell you if you have vaginal candidiasis and how to treat it 

Vaginal yeast infections can be treated with antifungal medications that are applied directly into the vagina as tablets creams ointments or suppositories A single dose of oral fluconazole can be used For more severe infections infections that dont get better or keep coming back after getting better other treatments might be needed 

Wearing cotton underwear might help reduce the chances of getting a yeast infection Also avoid taking antibiotics that has not been prescribed by your healthcare provider",363,1917,[en:0.9999972847179894]

Are there other associated symptoms with the pain How old are you How long does it last Does this happen all the time or only some times etc These questions are useful to help reach a diagnosis and a treatment or at least how to reduce it occurence 

In many cases abdominal pain after sex is bearable and often resolves within minutes and not lifethreatening while others maybe severe and long lasting However if the pain becomes too severe it can lead to avoidance of sex

Some common causes are immediately clear and others might require a detailed discussion with your physician and lab investigations where necessary to get to the root

Some known causes in no particular order are deep penetration orgasm dysorgasmia urinary tract infections UTI sexually transmitted infection STI interstitial cystitis irritable bowel syndrome IBS ovarian cyst uterine fibroids pelvic inflammatory disease PID endometriosis are some conditions that might result in painful sex or postcoital sex

Therefore to completely rule out the exact cause and possible complication you should go for a physical examination with your physician

During ovulation a couple of physical signs can be noticed in a woman 
The cervical mucus secretion increases and transforms into a raw egg white like consistency Its usually clear and thin 
Theres also an increased libido prior to ovulation 
Theres a slight rise in basal body temperature although tracking this can be a bit cumbersome
Some women may even feel a sharp abdominal pain during ovulationmittelschmerz

You should also know that having sex 35 days prior to ovulation and 12 days after can still result in fertilization

Ill also advise that you and your partner should see your physician for fertility tests that can help detect a possible problem

As you have stated you are most fertile during ovulation ie when an egg is released from your ovaries and this usually occurs 12 to 14 days before your next period starts
Therefore tracking your periods is a significant part of knowing when your ovulation is expected to be 

Some helpful signs of Ovulation are as follows 
  a raise in basal body temperature
  if you use a home ovulation kit you will notice increased levels of luteinizing hormone LH
  cervical mucus or vaginal discharge may appear clearer thinner and stretchy like raw egg whites
  breast tenderness
  a feeling of being bloated 
  possible light spotting
  and slight pain or cramping in your side

If after a year of trying with no pregnancy you should see a fertility expert to rule out and manage whatever may be the cause of the delay 

Good luck",183,827,[en:0.9999971261418952]

When a person spends long hours looking at electric screens in general television computers tablets or in your case mobile phones they tend to develop what is known as digital eye strain which is associated with exhaustion back and neck pain and in most cases the eyestrain leads to headaches 

The eye strain might be due to glare on the screen poor lighting in your surrounding improper computer brightness and color or a combination of these factors

Usually when this is that case we advise that you take frequent breaks from screen time adjust your posture by walking a short distance to stretch your neck arms and back to improve circulation You can also incorporate deep breathing lessons and short meditation time You should also ensure that you are using appropriate screen glare protectors the right chair and desk etc 

In most cases these techniques tend to help with the headaches and offers relief however if you believe the eyestrain is a becoming worse hindering you daily activities or not entirely due to the screen time I recommend you see an eye doctor

Normally one should have a heart rate of about 60  100 and a HR of 110 is faster than normal
Most times when the elevated heart rate lasts for long there is a medical reason for it such as anemia an underlying infection elevated thyroid hormone or reaction to medication Once these issues are addressed the HR will return to normal

What other symptoms do you have besides the cough Any fever weight loss vomiting or running nose What do you do for a living How old are you Male or Female Do you smoke Are you on any other medications What drugs did you get on your last visit to the doctor

And this can only be known when you visit a physician and your are physically examined

My advise is to visit your doctor request for some lab investigations 

Meanwhile get some rest drink a lot of fluids avoid dust eat a lot of fruits and vegetables as these will help boost your immunity to increase your chances of your body fighting whatever the cause

Good evening 

Watery or milky discharge from the breasts when one is not pregnant is not normal 

There is a condition called hyperprolactinaemia where the prolactin levels in the blood is high and usually results to this 

Prolactin is a hormone that is responsible for a woman to lactate or produce breast milk after child delivery 

Other causes include a pituitary tumour hypothroidism liver disease and kidney disease 

I advise that you go and see a doctor for a detailed history and physical examination You would also need to do some tests to ascertain the hormonal levels and even rule other other conditions 

Treatment would depend on the outcome of your visit to the doctor

So in between your shot and the implant you have been on pills yes 

Anyway after stopping depo shots it usually takes several additional months for the complete effect of the hormone to dissipate and to begin ovulating and having regular periods again therefore your chances of pregnancy are low 

Also for the new implant to be immediately effective it should be inserted within the first 5 days of our menstrual cycle but is only effective after 7 days of insertion if it is inserted at any other time in the menstrual cycle Other contraceptive measures such as condoms should be used during these first 7 days

There are no effective home remedies for keloids Also there isnt a single treatment plan that is best for all keloids We have to consider the location size and depth of the lesion the age of the patient and very importantly what treatment has been used in the past and how it was responded to

There are however numerous treatment plans which includes surgical excision intralesional steroid injection radiation therapy laser therapy silicone gel sheeting and pressure therapy 
Keloids tend to recur after surgical excision as a single treatment therefore a combination of therapies might be required 

My advise if that you go see a dermatologist who will examine the lesions and answer those above questions to design a treatment regimen for you

Your concern is understandable since there are different skin changes that might be mistaken by an untrained eye to look like genital warts Differential diagnosis may include syphilis 

Human Papilloma Virus the causative agent of genital warts is transmitted by skintoskin contact and because HPV can infect areas that are not covered by the condom condoms will not fully protect you against contracting HPV but condoms do help in reducing the chances of contracting HPV 

In most cases for genital warts to be diagnosed a doctor has to examine and physically check a mans genital area to see if warts are present doctors may apply a vinegar solution to help identify warts that arent raised and visible Afterwards a treatment regimen is discussed and offered

Im not a doctor but I will advise based on experience 

1 The mother should take food such as pap beverages milk  milobournvita etc if youre in Nigeria and other food that contains plenty fluid to aid breast milk flowing 

2 Mother should position the breast to babys mouth the more baby attempts to suck the quicker the flow of breast milk 

3 If no milk flow yet baby should be placed on NaN 1 milk It is available in any supermarket Immediately breast milk starts flowing NaN 1 should be stopped 

I am not very sure about the safety of honey for infants less than 1 year old but water with glucose is advised to be given if you couldnt get NaN 1 and milk is yet to flow This will prevent baby from starvation which could be fatal

My first question is why do you have to strain or push in order to urinate What happens when you do not strain 
Normally the contractile force of the bladder is sufficient for urine to come out with minimal effort and this strain or pushing can be due to problems with obstruction of the bladder outlet and urethra or due to nerverelated disorders

It is advisable that urinary symptoms should be investigated ASAP to rule out serious conditions Kindly visit your doctor or a urologist who will take a detailed history physical examination and request some investigations",113,576,[en:0.999997366582741]

First Libido is a persons overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity 
Do you have a low libido or you cant maintain an erection 
Please note that CIALIS does not increase a mans sexual desire sex drive or libido It helps increase blood flow to the penis and can help men with erectile dysfunction get and keep an erection for sexual activity when sexually stimulated It does not induce erections in the absence of sexual stimulation

Cialis is a prescription drug and must be prescribed by a doctor after examining you It is not appropriate or safe for everyone to take it as certain health conditions and other medicines can make it unsafe to take Cialis

During cold weather the testes retract upwards closer into the body For you it seems these retraction is what is causing the pain 

You might be experiencing testicular torsion which occurs when the spermatic cord that attaches the testicle to the body becomes twisted and reduces blood flow to the testicle If this is the case it is important that you see a physician for review and examination as soon as possible particularly if youre experiencing a high degree of pain instead of a dull ache and it lasts for more than 10  15 minutes 

Also if it happens during cold times a simple but temporary solution is will be to stay warm as often as possible

Do you itch all over your body or just in specific areas your vaginavulva region 

Vaginal itch during your period is a common experience It often is attributed irritation from your menstrual products or hormonal imbalances 

To avoid or lessen itch from irritation
 use unscented tampons or pads
 change your tampons and pads frequently
 use the appropriate size tamponpad for your flow avoiding highly absorbent sizes if not necessary
 avoid using scented products such as scented cleansing wipes in your vaginal area
 wash the area with only water and mild soap with no color or scent

As for hormonal changes occurring around your period this can cause vaginal pH to change therefore creating an environment for yeast overgrowth Along with itch other symptoms of a yeast infection may be present 

 discomfort when you pee
 swelling and redness
 cottage cheeselike vaginal discharge

Yeast infections are typically treated with antifungal medication which you may get over the counter at a pharmacy 

All in all this is not an uncommon situation however if the itching becomes unbearable or nonstop it might be the sign of a condition that should be diagnosed and treated by your doctor Go and see a gynaecologist

Is it itching worse with warm or cold water   

Usually itching after a shower is due to the associated dryness of the skin This is a form of aquagenic pruritus  Also some allergies manifest in the form of itching which may occur with or without rashes or skin changes when the body  It is also possible that some viral or fungal infections of the skin can cause generalised itching with or without rashes after a shower   

To reduce its occurrence you should avoid excessive dryness of the skin by using towels less often and preferably allowing your body air dry applying a moisturising lotion immediately after a bath change your soap shampoo to hypoallergenic ones and do not use hard sponges or scrub less vigorously 

My advice is that you do the above and if you dont get positive results you should visit a dermatologist who will examine your skin investigate the cause and provide an appropriate treatmentprevention regimen

The blood you are referring to is called lochia It is a normal expectation after delivery and this discharge usually contains blood mucus and soft tissue This is how the body removes all of the extra blood and tissue from the uterus that helped the baby grow

Lochia discharge typically continues for four to six weeks after childbirth a time known as the postpartum period Bleeding is heaviest the first few days after the baby is born but becomes lighter over days It varies from person to person and pregnancy to pregnancy 

Although its a normal occurence if you see large clots darkish things or experience very heavy flow  that soaks through a maxi pad within an hour please go and see your doctor or nurse 

This should not be mistaken with postpartum haemorrhage which is a more serious condition and requires urgent care

What you might be describing are sunken eyes and considering you are concerned now that means this is a new occurrence yes

Some causes of sunken eyes as as follows 
 Aging
 Chronic weight loss
 Poor sleep or other sleep disturbances
 Chronic dehydration
 Allergies

My advise  is to exercise get better sleep and drink enough water If no significant improvement please see a doctor who will take a medical history and visually examine your face and based on the findings ay request lab tests and give treatments",164,775,[en:0.9999975963812278]

Good evening 

As regards neonatal jaundice of the 3 day old baby i would advise that the child be taken to the hospital and assessed by a doctor possibly a pediatrician 

It is very pertinent that the serum bilirubin levels of the  child be estimated and the appropriate treatment instituted for the baby 

Treatment actually depends on the level of jaundice and not every jaundice is amenable to sunlight therapy 

In some cases the baby might even require exchange blood transfusion or simply phototherapy Jaundice not well treated can lead to permanent brain damage which is usually for life This is called Kernicterus 

So kindly advise them to take the child to the hospital

We may need to start from your sexual history Do you masturbate If yes you need to stop Masturbation reprograms your mind to want to climax as quickly as possible and move on to other things and thus you will have the same desire while having sex

You also have to work on your mind Sex and orgasm are firstly from the mind Train yourself to stay long by engaging in prolonged foreplay Then when you eventually penetrate take a brief pause after few thrusts It will help you last longer 

Note that the result wont be immediate You will have to keep practicing for a while to get results 

Hope this helps",135,629,[en:0.9999983092145703]

Husky voice or hoarseness of the voice is usually a symptom of disorders related to the vocal folds and in most cases is expected to clear in a few weeks

Quit smoke if she smokes

First of all it is almost impossible to catch a UTI or STI from a toilet and this is even less possible in men therefore lets remove the notion that this is what happened to you 

Secondly yellowish sperm can be quite innocuous but sometimes they are a cause for concern Are there other associated symptoms Pain on urination or discolouration of the urine Fever etc 

Therefore my advice is that you see a doctor to conduct some tests of particular interest is a complete blood count and urinalysis  urine mcs The results will provide insights to the cause and how to treat

Only tests can confirm pregnancy and considering your test was positive you might be pregnant or maybe it a false positive 

My advise is to repeat the test at a reputable lab for confirmation 

Also please note that bleeding or spotting is possible despite being pregnant and this can occur anytime from conception when the egg is fertilized to the end of pregnancy 

Light bleeding during early pregnancy happens due to the attachment of the fertilized egg to the uterine lining this is known as implantation bleeding It usually occurs during the time when you are expecting a normal menstrual period it is generally lighter in comparison to menstrual bleeding Implantation bleeding is usually light stops spontaneously and doesnt need treatment

Go and confirm your pregnancy status

Please help me",68,317,[en:0.9999977611849491],"Hi Arinola 
I am sorry about your experience This should stop or reduce after 3 months but in some cases it might not at that period 

One of the most important things to do is to note what food or substances trigger the vomiting or cause irritation and try to avoid them 

Another thing that can help is for you to eat small pieces of food over a period rather than a big mean at once

There have also been cases where drinking ginger based drinks have been found to help

Try to ensure you are hydrated as dehydration could spell huge danger for you and your baby sparkling drinks can also help Some sort of tight wrist bands have been found to be helpful

If you notice that your vomiting gets severe and you are feeling weak kindly ask to be taken to the hospital for monitoring to ensure you are nurses back to stability

I believe the above listed options can work and help you feel better but do keep an eye on how you feel for situations when you might need to see a doctor urgently

Chest pain may also be caused by problems in your lungs esophagus muscles ribs or even your nerves While some of these conditions are serious and maybe life threatening others will resolve with rest or analgesics 
However pains that do not resolve within days despite rest and analgesics will require a doctor evaluation and examination

Is this a recent occurrence or is it longstanding Besides the pain are there other symptoms Cough sweating a lot headaches or fever diarrhoea vomiting or constipation etc What do you do for a living Are you male or female How old are you

I always have swollen vagina lips after sex thats usually accompanied with heavy thick discharge and severe itching the discharge usually looks dirty please whats happening",28,176,[en:0.999997991654992],"Hi 

A swollen vulva  can be a natural response after rough sex either because of increased  blood flow to the area or from irritations and friction due to poor lubrication and minimal foreplay prior to intercourse It could also be from an allergic reaction to the condoms or artificial lubrication used In most cases it usually resolves within hours and doesnt have the associated symptoms you listed 

Swollen vulva is also a common symptom of vaginitis the inflammation of the vagina cause from a bacterial yeast or viral infection which is also associated with the other symptoms you have listed Bacterial vaginosis STIs and yeast infections are common culprits 

My advice is that you go to a doctor for physical examination and lab investigations to confirm cause and provide appropriate treatment depending on the cause 

Meanwhile abstain from sex temporarily until tests are carried out to prevent further irritations and worsening

A change in the duration of your periods can be due to innocuous reasons or something more serious 

First lets rule out the less serious stuff that can change the length of your period like a change in your schedule or stress a new birth control or particular medications you just started including pain killers excessive exercise or athletic activity significant weight changes or eating disorder Also women notice different kinds of changes in the features or characteristics of their period as they get older 

Other causes that are considered more serious might include thyroid disorders PCOS However they usually are accompanied by other symptoms such as acne or sleep disorders etc 

How long have you noticed the change If you havent noticed other symptoms it might be nothing to worry about However I would advice that you see your gynaecologist as soon as you can for a routine check up

How long has the pain been there and on a scale of 1  10 how severe is the pain What other symptoms are there Have you noticed any swelling on the abdominal wall Diarrhoea or constipation Vomiting Any blood in the stool Is there a fever Pain while urinating 

Well considering you have described it as a severe sharp it could be a hernia where a part of the intestines goes through a weak part of the abdominal wall resulting in severe pain It might also be testicular torsion from the testicles twisting by themselves causing lack of blood supply and severe pain 

Other causes of abdominal pain may include overeating or hunger pains usually not described as severe stomach fluinfection or food poisoning associated with history of eating bad food stomach cramps plus vomiting andor diarrhoea constipation bladder infection present with painful and frequent urination or appendicitis pain on the right side and worsened by touch moving or standing straight 

Causes vary therefore the best option is to go see a paediatrician to rule out a severe case especially if symptoms include the above stated ones andor is persistent

In most cases bleeding between periods is not usually a cause for concern This is referred to as spotting and its usually light bleeding You may notice light brown spotting in your underwear or a heavy flow resembling a regular period 

Although the reasons for irregular bleeding can vary according to individual health situations pregnancy birth control or underlying infection common causes of spotting include 

contraceptive use especially during the first few months of starting a new method 

pregnancy spotting is a common symptom of early pregnancy known as implantation bleeding

physical conditions and infections spotting can also be caused by infections and physical changes in the reproductive tract or hormonal imbalances seen in conditions like fibroids uterine or cervical polyps Pelvic Inflammatory Disease PID Urinary Tract Infections UTIs etc 

spotting can also occur around ovulation andor hormonal issues

Considering this is the first time you are noticing it and there are no other symptoms I will advice you monitor it and not any other changes around your menstrual cycle however if it continues you should speak to to gynaecologist for review and examination

By contraceptive pill can I assume you mean an emergency pill like postinor2 taken after unprotected sex 

If thats the case there are no life threatening effects to multiple use in most cases but like everything else we must use in moderation These are hormonal drugs and too much of it will definitely affect the body adversely in one form or another 

Most commonly it could make the period irregular which is not ideal if one is trying to avoid pregnancy For someone in a sexually monogamous relationship who really wants or needs to keep from getting pregnant relying only on emergency contraceptive pills is not an effective or cheap method There are various options of contraceptives asides condoms that you and your partner might be eligible to get 

I advise you speak to a family planning specialist to discuss your options 

Cheers 

PS contraceptive drugs do not protect one from sexually transmitted diseases We advise you insist on the use of condom if you do not know the sexual history or status of your partner",202,1036,[en:0.9999962315992076]

About the purging it happens sometimes Pregnant women sometimes have increased bowel movements causing them to pass watery stool However its important you stay hydrated Drink lots of water The weight of the pregnancy could compress a nerve that travels to your leg and this could give you the shocking sensation you feel Also make sure you lay these complaints to your obstetrician when next you go for antenatal

There are various tests that can be done to check on the health of the lungs and heart and this usually depends on the reason for the check Some tests can give an idea of both the lungs and heart while there may be some specific to each of them 
For example
 A Chest Xray will view both heart and lungs as well as well as a computerized tomography or CT scan and a Magnetic Resonance Image MRI
 An electrocardiogram or ECG testing the electrical activity of the heart and echocardiogram looking at the flow of blood through the heart will test just the heart
 Spirometry assessing the lung capacity will test just the lungs
 There are blood tests too that can give an idea of heart and lungs functions by means of markers like troponins

These are just a few that exist out there Their costs vary and as such it is best to have a sit down with your doctor to see which is best for you

Sorry about your complaint Masturbation is meant to be a safe practice but once it comes with a complaint its good to seek help like you just did

Even though I may not have come across may complains of this nature I will suggest these possible causes
 Being vigorous while performing the act and as such exerting some traume to the scrotum and hence the testicles which could lead to inflammation which in turn manifests as a swelling For this I will recommend being gentle and making sure you use enough lubricant while masturbating
 Being excessive with the act and possibly minor trauma to the scrotum could compound over time and lead to the swelling like the explanation above For this I will recommend the same as above and in addition try reducing the frequency of masturbation If you think its interfering with personal life look for any triggers and replace them with different activities like going out and hanging out with loved ones This will give you less time alone and reduce the frequency of masturbating
 The presence of a scrotal or testicular disease which may be noticed mostly after masturbating If you are experiencing symptoms like pain painful urination discharge the swelling is increasing over time visit a doctor preferably a urologist ASAP

Flatulence is a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly People get gas about 20 times a day on average 

Excessive flatulence can usually be treated by making changes to your diet and lifestyle Since diet is the main cause of gas you may have to keep a record of what you eat and drink to identify foods that cause you trouble You may have to stop eating certain foods

Youre most likely to get gas by eating foods such as 
 Beans
 Vegetables especially broccoli cabbage and onions
 Fruits
 Dairy products
 Wholegrain foods
 Soft drinks
 Fruit drinks

Other ways to reduce flatulence include
Eating smaller meals eating slowly avoiding gum and carbonated drinks not smoking choosing lowlactose dairy products doing exercises and use of probiotics

Sometimes there is an underlying medical condition that needs urgent attention such as food poisoning or an intestinal blockage Gallbladder problems and constipation also worsens flatulence

700,1,General Health,My symptoms are palpitations headache fainting nausea dizzinessbody weakness and recover a little after managing to eat some food,25,129,[en:0.9999967763760893],"Hello 

Good afternoon 

reading through your symptoms let us try to break them down a bit 

Firstly the palpitations how long has it been going on how old are you  are you hypertensive Are you diabetic 

Typically palpitations are pointers to a heart problem but there are other causes of palpitation that must be looked at  Some of them include  
 stress anxiety or panic attacks
conditions like hyperthyroidism 
Depression
Strenuous exercise
Stimulants including caffeine nicotine cocaine amphetamines and cold and cough medications that contain pseudoephedrine
Fever
Hormone changes associated with menstruation pregnancy or menopause 

You may want to look at these if any affects you 

For the headache this could be the result of so many things also notably stress fatigue fever too much screen time and malaria  which you need to be tested for 

Fainting attacks could be from the palpitation it could also result from hypoglycemia  low blood sugar make sure you eat as at when due 

These being said I suggest you see a doctor for a thorough examination and some blood work You maybe requested to do an ECG  which checks how fine your heart is working 

This would be followed by treatment with medications if necessary or referral to a specialist 

I hope this helps

Have you seen a doctor How long has this been going on Waht time of the day is the itching more intense  Do you share clothing items with your brother or friends 

And the boils How long and the distribution 

I suggest that you see a doctor as soon as possible for proper evaluation and treatment sometimes what you describe as boil maybe something else 

In the meantime I advise you to observe strict hygiene practices like bathing at least twice a day do not share clothes change your underwears twice a day at least do not share soap and sponge you may want to get some antihistamine to help with the itching 

Please also ask your brother to see the doctor with you so that he can be treated too 

I hope this helps

I am sorry about your experience This is something you might have to cope with till your child grows to a stage where you can control how she sleeps You might just have to put up with this One thing that might help is physical activity if the child plays actively during the day it might get her tired and make her sleep at night A pacifier might also help but be careful in the use of this Under no circumstances should you use sleeping pills for the child

Cough and catarrh are symptoms of different illnesses most commonly upper respiratory infection 

Most times the infection is usually of a viral nature and in that case  treatment is primarily with rest and fluid to let the body fight the infection on its own In the presence of fever overthecounter antiinflammatory pain relievers such as paracetamol helps 

Drugs like night nurse contain antihistamines which often make people drowsy but they block the effect of histamine and help relieve such annoying symptoms as sneezing itching and catarrh If your symptoms arent relieved within a few days then you might need to have a doctor to examine your chest and rule out other conditions

Eggs are a good source of nutrients and one of the healthiest foods out there However its one of the foods that has brought about a lot of debate especially regarding whether it is good or bad

An egg a day should not be harmful to a healthy individual Some feeding patterns even recommend more than 1 egg a day Some people use eggs in their daily meals as part of weight loss regimens Bodybuilders who want to bulk up tend to also consume a lot of eggs 

Just like everything moderation is key and listening to your body too is important You may want to look for any unfavourable changes to your body while you consume eggs or any other foods Many people are unaware that there is something like egg allergy for example But Im supposing you dont have that

In conclusion an egg a day is not unhealthy as long as youre having a balanced diet and  no unwanted issues with its consumption

Good morning Sorry about your worry 

Eczema can be quite a problematic skin characterized mostly by irritation 

Again it is good for that diagnosis to be made by a doctor for you as it may be something else as skin lesions may look similar but mean different things 

I highly recommend that you see a dermatlogist  skin doctor and have it checked out 

Meanwhile you can try these out for some relief prior to seeing the doctor 

take lukewarm baths

apply a  moisturizer within 3 minutes of bathing to lock in moisture

wear cotton and soft fabrics and avoiding rough scratchy fibers and tightfitting clothing

use a mild soap or a nonsoap cleanser when washing
air drying or gently patting skin dry with a towel rather than rubbing the skin dry after bathing

where possible avoiding rapid changes of temperature and activities that make you sweat

learn and avoid  individual eczema triggers

use a humidifier in dry or cold weather
keeping fingernails short to prevent scratching from breaking the skin

Secondary infertility the inability to conceive or achieve a term pregnancy after having a baby can be a distressing problem with couples And I can only imagine how you and your wife feel

The possible causes for this are similar to those for a couple who have never had a baby before These include
 The frequency of sexual intercourse
 Abnormalities in sperm production and characteristics for the man as well as ovulation issues in the woman
 Abnormalities with the reproductive organs like testicular diseases in the man and fallopian tube issues like blockages in the woman
 Body weight changes Ages of the couple etc
 Complications from the last pregnancy

These are a few of the possible causes that could exist Have you both been visiting a fertility clinic together It is important that you both go together as it also serves as a good support mechanism And if youve visited a clinic before and there has been no issues detected KEEP TRYING

Many women experience thick whitish discharge before a period due to the increased presence of progesterone a hormone involved in both the menstrual cycle and pregnancy 

However a thick whitish discharge accompanied by itching will most likely mean you have a yeast infection Watch out for a change in colour and other symptoms like pain on urination burning or other discomfort in and around the vagina rash or sores if consistency of discharge is of cottage cheese or frothy texture strong or foul odor etc

On account of recurrent occurrence I advise you see a doctor for some medications most likely antifungals for treatment and if you will require a maintenance drug for control

Increase in core temperature is one of the signs of ovulation or that ovulation has just occurred along with other signs that might include light spotting cramping or pain on one side of the pelvis breast tenderness abdominal bloating increased sex drive a heightened sense of smell taste or vision

The bumps may be as a result of the shaving with a blade Usually when using a blade or shaving stick the upper part of the skin may break and permit entry of bacteria or fungal organisms which cause a skin infection around the area And it may take a while for the infection to be cleared That is probably why you still have the bumps 

As for the underwear the itchy feeling has more to do with the material than the color Cotton or wooly materials will release particles of the skin of the area causing more itching

Now its a good thing you have stopped using blades Usually any triple action cream or ointment will do to clear the rash

Vaginal infections are a group of infections that affect the vagina It could be caused by different types of bacteria or viruses it can also be from yeast 
Therefore it is important to understand the exact cause so one can get treated and then avoid getting it again 

Although diagnosing them can be tricky especially without tests but symptoms often help to narrow the cause and type of infection down 
do you have any vaginal discharge what colour how heavy what smell any sensation of itching burning swelling or soreness around or outside of your vagina does it burns when you pee any history of similar symptoms in the recent past does you partner have any other complaints etc 

Meanwhile to help reduce the symptoms and reoccurrence the following can help 
 keep your vaginal area dry
 wipe from front to rear after using the toilet
 switch to looserfitting cotton underwear
 avoid regular tightfitting jeans or pantyhose
 avoid chemical irritants in deodorized tampons 
 do not use douches or feminine hygiene products as regular bathing is usually adequate to cleanse the vagina

Short Answer  a lot of things 

Chest pain and pain in general can have causes that are due to diseases of the underlying organs referred or radiated pain or just be musculoskeletal in nature Cause of musculoskeletal pain include heavy lifting weight lifting blunt trauma etc 

Chest pain is never something to ignore particularly because you have referred to it as severe There are a lot of organs in the chest region and it might be due to diseases of any of these organs also note that it might not be 
How would you describe this pain Is it permanent or it comes and goes On a scale of 1  10 how would you score it How long have you had it Any dizziness spells Any other symptoms Is it affecting your breathing These are some of the questions a doctor will need answers to while also examining you and maybe requesting for some labs 

Anyway my point is quite a few medical conditions are characterised by symptoms of chest pain disease of the heart lungs gastrointestinal system muscles and bones of the chest region even panic attacks etc therefore if you have sever chest pain for no known reason please see your doctor for review investigations and treatment ASAP 

The same thing for the lower back pain but this is commonly as a result of strain of the muscles and ligaments in the lower back which can stretch or tear due to excess activity or poor posture Disc injuries or inflammation of the joints of the spine are also common causes Your doctor will ask for your age your past medical history day to day activités etc to help reach a diagnosis Meanwhile you can try overthecounter pain relievers stretching and massages use ice packs or warm water bottles for the pain while you prepare to get a physical evaluation from a doctor

Sorry to hear about the symptoms you are experiencing
To clarify a few things  did these headchaes only start to occur after you discovered you had low blood Or was it the headaches that prompted you to seek care and make you discover
Also where were you told this and did they offer you any supplement pills or advice on how you should eat certain kinds of food to help with the blood levels Furthermore did you have any more tests done to discover whether any other causes might be attributable to the low blood levels

The headaches can indeed be a symptom of the low blood level but it is highly important that the underlying cause of the low blood level be attended to How well have you followed the dietary advice given since you said the cause was attributed to not eating well

If no advice was given on food please note that a few meals you can access easily to eat include beef chicken liver fish you can also be on the lookout for iron fortified cereals and bread You might also want to try painkillers like paracetamol just to help with your headache short term

Since you probably have a doctor you see kindly also return for followup care

Sores in the genital area have many causes but when combined with the other symptoms listed itchiness and associated painful urination plus a history of unprotected sex it is a high chance of STI 

My advice is to visit a doctor for physical examination and lab investigations to find the exact cause and be treated accordingly 

Meanwhile you have to discuss with your boyfriend so he can seek medical attention too and prevent reinfecting you after treatment or to transmit it to other sexual partners It is best that you do not have sex until the sores have subsided and until you have completed your treatment

Only that  it is safe to delay elective dental treaments  until after deliveryin women still  in their  1st  or  3rd trimestersThis is because of a  couple of factors vizThe risk of  exposure of the  foetus  in the first trimester of pregnancy to radiation from dental xray and also the risk of orthostatic hypotension hence the resultant  syncope that is likely to  happen when a  heavily  pregnant woman sits on the dental chair for  long while undergoing dental treatment
Howeverwhile  dentists would take adequate measures to reduce these risks dental treatment could still be done during pregnancydepending on the severity  of the patients symptoms and also depending on  whether the said treament is invasive or noninvasive
As for the  dental treatments which might warrant postponement until after deliverysuch treatments can be done anytime after delivery as long as  the woman has been certified fit by her doctors to go home
Even though there is no time framea dentist could decide to wait for three months depending on the emotional readiness of the patient and other patient based factors
However to the best of my knowledge  there  is no evidence from research  stating any benefit  to waiting for 3months  post deliverybefore initiating dental treatment",276,1341,[en:0.9999967775992527]

Doing any exercise with discomfort is a recipe for issues in future You may have a muscle tear a sprain etc Take it gradually do brisk walking and then as you proceed you can blend some walking with some jogging as you proceed just so you do not overwhelm your body Also taking rest days in between is important to get your body recovered and rebuilt injured tissues

I also hope this is not affecting your way of walking from normal to limping your posture the way you stand or spreading to other parts of your left lower limb your left thigh your left foot or beyond

Just a little tip on weight loss remember to eat healthy too Exercise compliments a healthy diet and the results are amazing

Itchy vagina with associated copious discharge are some of the symptoms of sexually transmitted infections especially when theres a history of unprotected sex Theres a very high chance that you have an STI 

Therefore I would advice you to see a doctor who will examine you and based on his examination and lab findings he will prescribe an appropriate medication for the infection 

Meanwhile please abstain from sexual activities and duly inform your partner as well

mfull",24,93,[en:0.9999951834112615],"Hi Success 

There are different ways to calculate your due date 

You can use your last menstrual period LMP The number of weeks that have passed since the first day of your last period indicates how old in weeks your pregnancy is To work out your likely due date count 280 days 40 weeks from the first day of your last period

Using the first ultrasound scan during your antenatal visit your healthcare provider will also check on fetal growth and monitor other development milestones Ultrasound scans ALSO provides the most accurate estimate for how many weeks pregnant you are and what your due date will be This is the MOST RELIABLE method and is particularly useful if you dont know the date of your last period or if your menstrual cycles are irregular

Nausea and vomiting are common in pregnancy especially in the first trimester usually referred to as morning sickness In some cases some pregnant women experience excessive nausea and vomiting that might result in hospitalisation from dehydration 

Seek medical help if vomiting is so severe or constant that the person cant keep down fluids or food The doctor may need to treat you for dehydration and may recommend medication to control vomiting during pregnancy

Not sure what you mean by he was given birth by a labelled below his tongue 

Are there any other developmental delays are there other things the baby should be doing that she hasnt started doing yet Crawling standing walking etc Can the baby understand simple commands like come sit and does he respond to sounds Is he making any sounds at all 

Children tend to develop differently and what obtains with baby A might not be the case with baby B but we dont expect to have a huge difference 
You may or may not have anything to worry about depending on the answers to these questions but my advice is to visit a consultant paediatrician a baby specialist who will examine the babys development milestones examine the mouth and frenulum the fold beneath the tongue the babys ears etc and based on the findings will either refer you to a speech therapist if required or just send you home that theres nothing to worry about

The thing with lumps in the breast is you may need to further characterize ita better understanding would be made in the clinic You could help with further information like size progressiontenderness or association with pain overlying skin features basically everything you can say about it would go a long way
Now being that you have just finished breastfeeding it adds an additional differentialranges from galactocele to fibroadenoma to abscess all depends on presentation to be confirmed with investigation
So that leaves us with having to go further to confirm what it is exactly A mammogram or ultrasound scandepending on your age

Mastitis is a possible diagnosis but unlikely on account of the history of blunt trauma to the breast The lumps you are feeling are possibly hematomas which are blood collections under the skin from the injury sustained 

Hematomas usually resolve on their own but that can take some time up to 46 six weeks My advice is that you visit your doctor again after 4 weeks if it hasnt resolved The antibiotics will help to prevent an infection 

Also you will benefit from a breast ultrasound to makeconfirm the diagnosis and rule out any underlying issues

Good morning and sorry about the sprain It takes a while for sprains to heal completely sometimes up to three weeks or more 

This depends largely on activity of the affected limb Excessive usage will lengthen the time it takes to heal 

I suggest that you do not try to run for now and allow it heal properly You can also use some analgesics to help with the pain

First of all I cannot speak categorically on this but there is almost no chance that she would have been tested with a used needle especially in a facility such as UCH Also all needles are discarded after use Usually we encourage people insist that a new needle or lancet is opened in their presence just before the test is done 

If nothing else happened outside the history you have given and no other chances of exposure to HIV had occurred I dont see the need for PEP Is she still on the drug

It is normal for a post natal lady to resume menses 40 days after the birth of the baby

A couple of things could cause painful sex 

It could be that your vagina isnt properly lubricated This causes bruising and injuries leading to pain 

The force of penetration could also be an issue The more the force the more painful it is 

Also there could be some previous injuries you sustained which have not healed and they get bruised during penetration 

Theres also something called vaginismus Its a condition where there is constant and excessive contraction of the vaginal muscles during sex

What you have described is what is called dyspareunia pains during sexual intercourse  For some women the pain is only a temporary problem for others it is a longterm problem

To better understand this condition you have to provide answers to certain personal questions such as age sexual history and habits any history of sexual violence etc This will help to narrow the possible cause and subsequent management protocols 

Oftentimes the pain results from inadequate vaginal lubrication firing sex which is often resolved when the woman becomes more relaxed when sufficient amount of foreplay is introduced or if the couple uses a lubricant

Other reasons for painful sex may include one or more of the following 

1 Vaginismus which is the involuntary spasm of the vaginal muscles usually due to a underlying fear 
2 Vaginal infections such as yeast infections may also result in intermittent sexual pains 
3 Cervical uterus and ovarian changes or deformities such as cysts polyps and fibroids can lead to pain especially at deep penetration
4 Endometriosis
5 Pelvic inflammatory disease PID With PID the tissues deep inside become badly inflamed and the pressure of intercourse causes deep pain
6 During menopause the vaginal lining can lose its normal moisture and become dry 
7 Vulvodynia a chronic pain that affects a womans external sexual organs 

As stated earlier treatment is based on the identified cause Meanwhile make sure to practice gentleness and patience use sufficient amounts of waterbased lubricants

All symptoms including mood changes must be discussed with your physicianobstetriciangynaecologist as they can be help with diagnosis In some cases you might require sexual therapy and interventions to manage past sexual and non sexual traumas

835,8,Skin Care,I itching around my tight and scrotum area that forms dark scaly patches on the affected area I have used some form of antifungal cream and it goes but returns back after some time I also have same around the upper in between of the anus with a tear What  do I do,60,263,[en:0.9999971094909661],"Hi 

Im not exactly sure I understand your question 
However what I understand from your question is this you have the urge to scratch around your anus and scrotum resulting in black patches no long term relieve despite using anti fungal creams and you also have an anal tear 

Did you notice the tear before the itching or vice versa Whats your diet like How often does this happen Do you notice any triggers 

Perianal itching has many causes which may include haemorrhoids warts and worms 

You will have to see a doctor who will examine the area and offer advise based on the examination 

Meanwhile use soap and water to wash the idea after going to the toilet ensure a very strict hygiene and oil well as dry skin can also cause the itching Wear loosefitting cotton underwear that allows sweat to evaporate And eat a high fiber diet that contains a lot of fruits and vegetables

My 74 years old mother is complaining of painful vagina after urinating What should we do 

I am 42 years old I have finished two packs of ulcer kit I am now on Cellgivity capsules Should I restart the ulcer kit if infection of H Pylori continue For how long should I continue with the ulcer kit

Thank you",76,319,[en:0.9999973169251389],"Hi 

Your mother possibly has a UTI burning sensation and frequent urination are classic signs However it is important that she be examined by a physician because older citizens may present such symptoms in case of other diseases and vice versa 
A urinalysis andor urine culture will help rule out the actual cause of the pains felt while urinating 

As for you was ulcer diagnosed by a physician with clinical signs or was any investigation done  Also was it stated that Hpylori was the culprit 
Ideally you should feel better within 1 to 2 weeks of medication and thats obviously not the case here  I cannot speak for the role of Cellgevity capsules in ulcer treatment therefore I will advice that you have stool test and possibly urea breath test to confirm diagnosis Your physician will be in a best position to examine and investigate your health

The morning after pills have minor side effects which typically last only a few days they include

 Nausea or vomiting
 Dizziness
 Fatigue
 Headache
 Breast tenderness
 Bleeding between periods or heavier menstrual bleeding
 Lower abdominal pain or cramps

Sometimes emergency contraception can also change the length and duration of your monthly menstrual cycle making your next period come as much as a week earlier or a week later than usual If your next period is significantly late you might consider repeating the PT 

Also if you have bleeding or spotting that lasts longer than a week or develop severe lower abdominal pain within weeks of taking the morningafter pill please contact your doctor

Are you male or female How old are you Are you on any medications Do you know what you are allergic to 

Patchy hair loss can be as a result of a few things such as alooecia areata or ringworm infections or just some hormonal changes Based on the additional skin symptoms you have mentioned the hair loss could be added symptoms of a more general condition 

My advice is that you seek the services of a physician or a consultant dermatologist for review and subsequent treatment based on the confirmed diagnosis

Good evening Thank you for using wellvis 

Constant headaches can be an indicator of elevated stress levels in the human body Stress can come from various sources traffic workplace personal family  finance to mention but a few 

Again it might also be some pointer to some illnesses that may need to be checked out 

I advise you see a doctor who will evaluate you properly and maybe order some tests and treat you appropriately 

If you by chance use glasses you can try seeing the optometrist to review your lenses if you have not seen one pls schedule a visit 

Meanwhile you can try relaxing more listen to music  hangout with friends take a vacation or a little leave off from work and get enough sleep  lack of this can cause headaches

Good evening and thanks for choosing wellvis 

Where is the lump located For how long  Is it painful or painless 

These are some questions that need to be answered 

That being said we advise that every lump found on the body should actually be removed and taken to pathology and examined 

A pathologist is a doctor whose work is to analyze cells of the body and determine which is cancerous or not and his result usually determine the way treatment will go 

So my best advise is to go see a doctor as soon as possible and have a proper evaluation

Im sorry to hear about your distress If you think youre likely to be HIVpositive could it be because youre aware of the HIV status of the person youre having sex with and its positive

If you are unaware of their status kindly encourage them to go for an HIV test too

If your partner is positive are they currently using Antiretroviral drugs If they are not please ensure that they visit a hospital to get appropriate care

In your case with regards to you fears if your test confirmed you negative and you had unprotected sex afterwards you might need to wait for about a month or more before trying another test depending on what test you want to do Where did you have this initial test too 

I strongly advise however that you start to protect yourself by using a condom Its highly important to prevent HIV rather than have to deal with its life long effects

NO you cannot be declared cured within 4 months of using drugs for tuberculosis

Midlife crisis isnt officially a medical diagnosis and because there is no specific sets of symptoms or signs to specifically diagnose midlife crisis doctors tend to have a difficult time addressing it  
However what we can do is to rule out identifiable health issues based on the symptoms you are experiencing either physically or mentally and to ensure that it is indeed just a midlife crisis and not a manifestation of an underlying illness 

My advice is to visit a physician for review have a discussion regarding the symptoms and signs you are experiencing and possibly have a medical checkup If required you might be advised to speak to a therapist who will help you develop better cognitive and emotional coping skills with the said crisis

Twitching or spasms of the eyelids often occur with no identifiable cause but might be worsened by the following 

 eye irritation or infections 
 fatigue lack of sleep physical exertion and stress 
 some medication side effects
 use of alcohol tobacco or caffeine

If the twitching results in uncontrollable winking or blinking that affects your daily life then you must visit a doctor preferably a neurologist for review and examination 

Meanwhile some conditions you should avoid are 
eye infections like conjunctivitis Apollo 
dry eyes and irritants such as wind bright lights direct sunlight or smoke
fatigue and stress
excess alcohol or caffeine
stop smoking if you smoke

I understand you are used to an exact duration or date of your menstrual cycleflow But occasionally it is possible to have a delay by few days especially when you are not pregnant One of the things that could cause this is stress Stress alters the normal body hormonal levels leading to delay in menstrual flow 

Another thing is contraceptive medications If you are on any form of contraception whether planned or emergency it can affect your flow

Sometimes nothing may be wrong The body is not exactly a programmed system where certain things MUST occur at FIXED times It may just be a little delay which will correct itself

age as you get older and closer to menopause the flow will reduce this is due to hormonal changes 

contraception and birth control also tends to affect the volume of your flow or duration 

weight and diet losing or gaining a large amount of weight will alter your menstrual cycle  

stress and exercise poor sleep eating disorders medications and other hormonal conditions can also affect your menstrual cycle 

I encourage you to track and monitor your period noting exact date it starts and ends duration PMS symptoms or other symptoms you might be experiencing and if you notice a significant change for more than two to three months please speak to your gynaecologist

892,1,General Health,Good day please I want to enquire more about PGD I am AS and my partner is AS we got info that PGD helps to prevent having SS children Please I want to know how it works and how true and the cost,46,195,[en:0.9999974796266079],"Hello 

Preimplantation genetic diagnosis PGD is a procedure that is performed during in vitro fertilisation IVF a form of assisted reproductive technology 

IVF is the process of fertilisation by extracting eggs from a woman and retrieving a sperm sample from the man and manually combining them to form an embryo babies develop from embryo The embryos is then transferred  implanted into the uterus of the mother 

With PGD the genetic makeup of each embryo can be determined before being transferred into the uterus of the woman during IVF therefore almost completely eliminating the risks of bearing a child with sickle cell Please note that PGD is not 100 accurate 

Other options are prenatal diagnosis which is usually done while the couple is already pregnant it involves selective abortion of affected pregnancies And is significantly cheaper 

Cost of the procedure differs based on location centre and health status of the couple However it is said to be in the millions or Naira 

Speak to your primary physician or gynaecologist if you would like to consider this

893,12,Women's Health,For someone who is still a virgin that underwent Pap smear test can she loose her virginity in the process,20,106,[en:0.9999971905535152],"Hi 

No getting a Pap smear doesnt take your virginity 
Virginity has a personal definition it is not a medical or physical condition People are commonly considered virgins if theyve never had penetrative sex 

Please note that hymens can be stretched open the first time during vaginal sex sometimes causing some pain or bleeding this however is not always the case for everyone There are other ways that a hymen can be stretched open riding a bike doing sports or putting something in the vagina accidentally to on purpose like a tampon or during a Pap smear When the hymen is stretched open it doesnt grow back

Virginity and the presence of a closed hymen are not mutually exclusive therefore you cant tell if someone has had sex by the way their hymen looks or feels Some people are born with hymens that are naturally open also there are many other activities besides sex can stretch your hymen

Surviving sexual assault can change a persons body and mind in ways that isnt even clear It is possible that sex or the thought of it lead to feelings of sadness flashbacks or distressful and negative physical or mental reactions in survivors It is also possible that none of these happen too 

Although I have very limited information I think what you are experiencing in your sexual life now is a reaction to the trauma that occurred 

My advice is that you get in touch with a therapist who will help you navigate these negative reactions and also help you find healthy ways of coping and dealing with them

How and when were you diagnosed with diabetes How and where have you been monitoring your blood sugar Do you own a glucometer Do you check before or after a meal 

Symptoms of diabetes vary and this is often dependent on how elevated your blood sugar is In many cases when blood sugar is only slightly elevated you might not have any discernible physical symptoms However when significantly elevated or long lasting signs and symptoms of diabetes may include the following drinking more water increased urination high thirst and hunger weight loss regular tiredness eye problems injuries that doesnt heal quickly and frequent infections 

Complications of diabetes develop gradually and the longer you have uncontrolled blood sugar the higher the risks of complications They can be disabling and lifethreatening They include cardiovascular problems such as coronary artery disease heart attack stroke and narrowing of arteries atherosclerosis Nerve damage which may lead to loss of all feelings and sensations in the limbs and in men it may lead to erectile dysfunction Damage to the kidneys eye etc may also occur 

Ideally a test called Glycated hemoglobin A1C test is the best way to know what your diabetic status You should visit your doctor or a lab and request for this test You should also repeat a fasting and 2hours post prandial blood sugar at a reputable centre to confirm diagnosis 

Meanwhile ensure that you eat healthy foods that are low in fat and calories but higher in fiber Focus on fruits vegetables and whole grains Get more physical activity of about 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day such as brisk daily walks or swimming And dont forget to aim to lose some body weight to reduce the risk of diabetes

Should you require an appointment or help finding a doctor or lab in your locality fill this for and we might be able to help you locate one httpswellvishealthtypeformcomtoWAPmQe

Is your cough productive What colour is your sputum Vomiting Any fever Have you been diagnosed with peptic ulcer in the past 

It sounds like you have a bad chest infection  thats why the cough syrup will not address the cause of the cough but you will need to visit a hospital to confirm that 

You will be required to do a full blood count and possibly a chest Xray and based on your results you might get some medications including antibiotics

A little blister is very subjective What you have referred to as a little blister might be big enough for serious concern 
Blisters or sores on the labia sometimes happen due to friction and resolve on their own while sometimes it may be due to certain skin disorders or as symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection STI

The associated pelvic pain and pain during penetration intercourse is very suggestive of an STI 
You will need a physical examination and tests to identify the actual cause and a definitive diagnosis It is also important to find out if the cause is an STI and subsequently treat to avoid spreading it to sexual partners 
You are advised to abstain from sexual activities for now 

Please note that untreated STIs can cause serious health complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease PID infertility scarring of the reproductive organs and an increased risk for ectopic pregnancy

Please endeavour to visit a clinic as soon as you can

Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus HBV It can be deadly if not treated early enough
The virus is passed from person to person through blood semen or other body fluids
Commonly spread by sexual contact sharing of needles or from mother to child

Having a chronic HBV infection can lead to serious complications such as the scarring of the liver cirrhosis liver cancer or liver failure

Once diagnosis has been made treatment modalities or management is determined by your doctor preferably a gastroenterologist based on duration of the virus acute or chronic Antiviral medications and liver supplements are offered in treatment 

I advise that you speak to a doctor or specialist for management",148,736,[en:0.999997212664096]

Please note that the washing that was done is a routine dental treatment that is supposed to be done  every 6 months and it removes  accummulated plaquecalculus and stains on the teeth
Infact even without having any dental complaint we need to have such a proceedure done every 6 monthsIt is like a way of cleaning  dirts in your   mouth
Having said thatthere are lots of factors that can cause teeth sensitivity known as dentine hypersensitivityExamples include factors like frequent consumption of acidic fizzy drinkswrong brushing tehniques to mention but a few
Basicallythe enamel  is the outermosthardest and  protective layer of the teeth while the dentine which is the next layer after the enamelis not as strong
In view of thisany insult to the tooth that degrades the enamel will expose the naturally sensitive dentine to further injuryThat is why the sensitivity phenomenon is called dentinal hypersensitivity
Sorry for your persistent case of teeth sensitivityI  however  think you need to visit the dentist once more for a thorough assessment

Firstlyhow old is your Son
The age is important because Isolated color change an be a sign of dying tooth tissuesSuch a  case of isolated color change is usually seen following trauma to the upper anterior teethas seen in fallsroad traffic accidents and  playground accidents
However when this happensit is important to seek dental help so as to prevent early loss of that  milkbabydeciduous tooth and also so as to intervene before any obstruction or damage to the underlying permanent anterior teeth occurs
No cause for alarmAll you need do is take the child for dental checkupA dentist will examine and have an xray of the tooth done and he or she would ensure the child gets the needed ageappropriate treatment

920,13,Pregnancy,I did serum pt twice and they both says its positive but the ultrasound and urine test done both appears negative But am being diagnosed of fibroid and I feel backache and get tired easily and am as well ovulatingcould I still b pregnant even after Ive missed my period for over a month,59,286,[en:0.9999970452326099],"Hi 

When was your last period Have you been pregnant in recent time When and where did you do the tests 

A false positive pregnancy test result is possible but not common it is when the test is positive but you are not pregnant You may get this result if you are taking a medication that contains hCG pregnancyrelated hormones or due to certain health issues

My advise is to request a quantitative hCG test also repeat the scan and a different centre and consult a gynaecologist for review on account of the fibroid and back ache 

As regards being pregnant only tests can confirm but if you are ovulating and you are having unprotected sex yes you can be pregnant

It sounds like you might have a skin infection possibly tinea corporis known as ringworm They cause circular shaped patches that often merge to form a bigger and less circular shape it may turn flaky and scaly but is quite itchy 

You should visit a dermatologist for review  definitive diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible 

Meanwhile you may get overthecounter OTC antifungal cream lotion or powder to help reduce the itch Also ensure to keep your skin clean by showering multiple times a day and also ensure your skin and genital region is particularly dry because ringworm thrives in wetmoist areas change your socks and underwear at least once each day dont share clothes or towels with someone who has ringworm and wash your hands with soap and water after playing with pets But most especially visit a doctor dermatologist for a review soon

From your complaints its very likely that your previous blood pressure readings are actually elevated due to your anxiety prior to measuring it I need you to know that at 19 years of age the least of your problems should be hypertension as long as theres no underlying medical condition

My question is 3in1

Ive heard insinuations that urinating immediatelysome minutes after sex could prevent pregnancyinfection Please how true is this Im trying to conceive and I do feel the urge to urinate immediately after sex sometimesJust like today and I had to wee

My second question is that after sex sperm comes out of my vagina sometimes almost immediately and  at other times after some minuteshours Does this call for concern and can I still get pregnant  Though its been happening for years now even before I had my daughter two years ago I used to lie still in bed and sometimes raise my legs against the wall so that the sperm will not come out I want to get pregnant again please

Thank you",156,749,[en:0.9999954295108703],"Sex happens in the vagina not the urethra So urinating after sex does not prevent pregnancy
During sex organismssome of them may be infectious are exchanged between partners and some may get into the urethra Urinating after sex may flush the urethra as an attempt to remove organisms but dont rely on it Practice safe sex

After sex semen flows back out of the vaginaseminal effluvium This is expected and normal as the vagina does not have a lid Dont be alarmed by it and dont get scammed by quacks who wants to steal money from you in the name of treatments

A man releases between 50  250 million sperms per milliliter of sperm upon ejaculation Only 1 is needed to fertilise the females ovumegg So unless your partners semen or sperms have a problem you dont have a problem

However if your partner and you have been having adequate sexual intercourse which means
1 Penovaginal sex
2 at least 3 times per week on alternate days
3 the male partner ejaculates inside the woman
4 and it has been for at least 12 months
but no pregnancy See a gynecologist for assessment",241,1069,[en:0.9999969362746864]

Usually those kind of growths can be caused by shaving with blades They could just be an irritation occurring in response to your underwear

924,1,General Health,What causes muscle pool in the leg,7,34,[en:0.9999963978680798],"Hello Chuks 

Good morning By muscle pool I believe that you are referring to muscle pull or muscle cramps 

There are quite a few notable causes of muscle pull or cramps 

When there is poor blood circulation to the legs it can result to cramps This is one of the reasons you are advised not to sit down for very long hours at a stretch 

Another reason is dehydration You need to make sure you get in enough fluids into your system 

Another cause is muscle fatigue which occurs whena muscle or group of muscles have been used repeatedly without allowing them time for adequate rest and recovery 

Then for those who exercise it is good to engage in warm up exercises before the main activitiy to make sure youdont develop cramps 

Another cause is exercising in hot weather This is not very helpful as one gets quickly dehydrated 

 I hope this helps

Good evening 

Spotting in pregnancy is not a good sign 

It could be a sign of a threatened miscarriage since you are just 5 weeks 

Aside the spotting any other problem like lower abdominal pains  Painful urination  Vaginal discharge  

And since you say its only when you take the omega 3 and pregnacare you see it I advise you stop the omega 3 and just stick to the pregnacare alone 

I will also strongly advise that you go see your doctor Have you registered for Antenatal  If no pls do ASAP

Having some form of anxiety at one point or the other in our lives is a normal thing especially in situations that we are unfamiliar with The responses to anxiety varies 
However when symptoms of anxiety become larger than the events that triggered them and when they begin to interfere with your life they could be signs of an anxiety disorder

To diagnose anxiety disorders you will have to speak to a medical professional such as a clinical psychologist or behavioural therapist who will also help you identify coping mechanisms 

Meanwhile ensure you eat a healthy diet limiting caffeine abstaining from alcohol and smoking and also consider exercising regular and meditation These have been known to help with anxiety issues

If you have tested positive then you should get to any General Hospital or teaching hospital around you to do a confirmation test to be sure If the result remains positive you will be put on drugs immediately Its important that you are started on treatment immediately as the earlier you start the better I want you to know that being tested positive is not a death sentence it doesnt mean that the world has come to an end I know people who have been positive for over 20 years and are still alive and thriving They are doing fine because they are taking their drugs and following instructions that they were given As long as you are on drugs you will do fine with nothing to worry about People who are on their drugs and comply with directions get to have kids who are born negative and are uninfected So anywhere you are head to a General Hospital or Teaching hospital and ask for a confirmation test or the HIV clinic and you will be managed as required

The decision on breastfeeding is made in agreement with the mother the family and the doctor If the babys parents can afford to sustain the usage of formula feeds for the child for as long as the child needs it more than 6 months then not breastfeeding is an option HIV positive mothers can breastfeed the child when born is placed on drugs for a few weeks the mother is placed on drugs too usually during or before Pregnancy and if she uses her drugs well the chances it infection are almost nil They are also advised not to mix formula and breastmilk if they choose breastmilk then they must give breastmilk alone and not mix with formula this is very important
They can breastfeed for as long as 1 year exclusively for 6 months and with supplementary feeds for the next period

Infections are the most common cause of swollen lymph nodes 

Lymph nodes typically help the body fight off infections they work by trapping microorganisms to prevent them from infecting other parts of your body 
Swollen nodes in the groin can be caused by an injury or skin infection in the legs or foot some sexually transmitted infections STIs can also cause swollen lymph nodes in that area

Do you have any other symptoms Vomiting rash night sweats weight loss loss of appetite fatigue etc Also how long have you noticed it Is it painful 

In the absence of other symptoms I wouldnt be worried 
I would ask that you monitor it and visit a doctor if it increases in size or there are noticeable growths of other lymph nodes neck armpits back of your ears etc or of it persists for up to 4 weeks and other symptoms appear 

Meanwhile resting and applying a warm moist compress to the swollen area may help to relieve pain and swelling Also try to find the source possibly an injury if possible 
You will also benefit from a physicians review and check up as soon as possible

Can you describe this lumps Size consistency Do you have any other symptoms 

The lumps maybe something simple like ingrown hairs or razor bumps from shaving or more serious like genital warts from HPV The fact that you have had unprotected sex also exposes you to the possibility of an STI like syphilis 

You will be best served by visiting a physician for review and examination to rule out any of these causes and subsequently prescribe medications for you

Good evening Yes anxiety can cause high blood pressure BUT just a momentary rise in blood pressure which normalizes after a while or when the source of the anxiety is gone 

It is usually the bodys response to danger  the flight fight or fright syndrome 

If one has a sustained increased in blood pressure over three measurements at different times it warrants an investigation and physical examination by a doctor

Good morning 

The urge to urinate more frequently might be due to some causes 

Firstly if you have been taking in more fluids lately  water  you will definitely have the urge to urinate more 

Secondly a urinary tract infection may be the cause The urge to urinate in urinary tract infections may or may not be accompanied by lower abdominal pains and slight fever 

Another possible cause can be diabetes When last did you have your sugar checked 

I suggest you go get a fasting blood glucose test done asap 

In view of the possible Urinary tract infection i strongly advise that you go see a doctor for a detailed history examination and investigation to ascertain the cause of the urge and get you treated appropriately

Good morning 

A swelling below your vaginal lips could mean some things It could be a lipoma  which is an accumulation of fat cells or it could be a Bartholins cyst It can also be a wart  genital  or just another growth 

My best advise is a visit to see a doctor who will properly look at it and decide what it is and then decide what the best mode of treatment 

I hope this helps you

Good morning and top of the day 

According to the producers of Fem Fresh it has been designed to clean your vagina and make you feel fresh all day long 

However the vagina is a selfcleaning organ and does not really need help cleansing itself

What we advise When showering or bathing wash your vulva with warm water and mild or unscented soap 

Separate your labia and let the warm soapy water clean all around the clitoral hood and between your labia 

These should help your vagina stay clean Also change your underwear at least twice a day take a shower at least twice a day 

Do not abuse medications especially antibiotics but take medications only on prescription 

I hope this helps

Your serum prolactin result shows a moderate elevation You are expected to take the drugs for up to 68 weeks and repeat the test a few times to show if there is a consistent drop in the level of prolactin Based on the result your doctor might make some changes to your medications 

So to answer your specific question you will have to repeat the test but meanwhile please continue your medication and speak to your doctor if you have any side effects or concerns 

It is important to note that elevated prolactin maybe as a result of many things therefore you might be expected to carry out additional tests to confirm the cause

PostExposure Prophylaxis must be started within 72 hours after exposure to HIV and should be used only in emergency situations

If you are prescribed PEP you will need to take it every day for 28 days then return to your health care provider for repeat HIV testing

Do you have any other symptoms besides the lumps Does it bleed 

Because it is spreading the lumps are unlikely to be ingrown hairs or razor bumps from shaving And is more likely to be something more serious like genital warts from HPV 
If you have an history of unprotected sex or multiple partners then you are at risk of an STI like syphilis 

My advise if that you go to see a physician for review and examination to rule out any of these causes and subsequently prescribe medications for you

Sorry about what youre experiencing Is this a recent occurrence How long has this been for

Do you indulge in foreplay before penetration This may help delay the time to ejaculate 

Also have you discussed with your partner about this Its important you both have this discussion so you can work out ways to go through this

Some schools of thought recommend slower strokes while penetrating during sex which increases the time to ejaculation You can also do the stopstart method whereby you stop penetration for a bit and then proceed 

While there exists medical products that may numb the sensation around the penis to allow you last longer Ill recommend you talk with a health professional before indulging in those 

Wellvis has a live chat feature where you can contact a verified health practitioner and get the necessary advise you need Why not give it a try to have a more personalised experience

How long ago did this happen Was it rapidly progressive How stiff are the joints

Most likely you may have had nerve damage that is the cause of your predicament However you need to be properly examined by a doctor to clearly determine this and make sure it is not caused by any other condition linked to your muscles 

I suggest you book an appointment with a doctor You will also need lots of physiotherapies to enable you to start moving Joints stiffness is usually a complication of lack of use and will take some time to free up and it has to be gentle and gradual

First of all I hope youre feeling much better following your recent surgery

Regarding sexual activity most surgeons recommend waiting a minimum of 46 weeks after surgery before having intercourse This allows for the pain to subside and for the surgical wound to heal better There are other factors involved depending on the reason for the surgery

However when you do resume sexual intercourse it is recommended to wait for at least 6 months before getting pregnant if you are trying to

Your followup checks with your gynaecologist is very important and you should report any worrying symptoms like a high fever nausea or vomiting severe pain bleeding from the surgical site chest or breathing issues abnormal vaginal discharge etc

Also moderate walking is helpful in your healing process and eating healthy too with high fibre to avoid constipation

Itchy private part could signify a lot of things but usually it is attributed to an ongoing infection The discharge supports an infection as well The blood stain could be as a result of scratching or from the infection of the private part also 

There are important questions to help unravel this puzzle such as your sexual activity whether it is safe or not the period of your cycle in which you are general hygiene recent antibiotic usage recent treatment and so on

The best step to take now is to get to a hospital with a good laboratory and get a test done This will help to know the culprit bacteria protozoa etc and to know the appropriate drug to use with the right dose and duration 

Poorly treated infection usually have its attending long term complications

Considering its only there when you have an erection its likely to do with your vessels 

Who would you describe this lumpbump hard soft jelly like etc How old are you  

Usually a hard swelling that suddenly appears on the shaft of the penis after sex or masturbation is possibly a lymphocele which appears when the lymph channels in your penis are temporarily blocked I expect this to subside and shouldnt cause any long lasting issues However please visit a doctorurologist for check up as soon as you can

Good morning 

As regards the blood thing from what you have just described it looks like you get to sustain bruises in your vagina that get to bleed 

I feel you may not be as wet as he thinks you aere before penetration 

How long do you indulge in foreplay

I advise that you increase the time for foreplay before penetration 

Then I also suggest that you see a doctor for evaluation as there are other causes of post coital bleeding 

I hope this helps

Sometimes period blood can actually be brownish after you see the pure red one Its perfectly normal Atimes you get to see some variations that may seem abnormal

If you are on implant it could also cause this for some people

Good evening Sorry about your worries Regarding anxiety the key to managing anxiety is mainly by identifying your triggers and trying to avoid them 

Some triggers include 

a stressful job or work 
withdrawal from drugs or certain medications
side effects of certain medications
trauma

You may also want to try deep breathing exercises occasionally It actually helps 

If your job stresses you consider getting a new one 
Some long term anxiety triggers like financial problems may take a while 

If avoiding them does not work  you may want to see a therapist

Sorry about the discomfort you are facing with your condition

My reply will be on the assumption that the presence of the lipoma was confirmed my a trained health professional

Lipomas are usually not harmful but cause aesthetic discomfort as in your case and occasionally get infected or are painful Gladly you dont seem to be affected by the last two 

Generally lipomas are removed under local anaesthesia as its a minor surgery

Good morning  Concerning your period I believe you should give it some timeIt will return Postinor is notorious for altering the cycle of users and taking that amount in quick succession may have caused this scenario 

Again going forward why not use other means of protection like using a condom rather than using a lot pf postinor It will save you this headache in the future

Quick or premature ejaculation is relative How long do you last Is this a personal concern or has your partner also complained 
When did this start and can you think of any significant event that surrounded the time it started Are there any particular stressors in your life presently Does this also occur whenif you masturbate Are you on any medications  

Without answers to these question Im unable to tell you the exact reason why you might be experiencing this however some changes to your sexual routine that may prove helpful are  some men have being able to delay ejaculation when they masturbate within an hour before intercourse while some completely avoided sex temporarily thus relieving the associated sexual pressures The startandstop methods whereby you stop sex when you are close to ejaculation and only continue when you have regained control the squeeze method pelvic floor exercises and use of desensitising condoms are also practices that might help

Good morning The only way for you to determine if you are pregnant or not right now is to go for a scan A scan will look into your womb and show the contents 

How old was the pregnancy before you took the cytotec

It is alos good to note that even after an abortion or miscarriage one still feels pregnant till after a few weeks when the pregnancy hormones completely get cleared out fo the system

1064,1,General Health,Hey i have been experiencing delayed ejaculation and sometimes am not anbale to reach there what could be the problem,23,117,[en:0.9999946296584746],"Hi 

Although there is no specific time that indicates a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation but when you are feeling frustrated and have to discontinue sex due to fatigue loss of erection or a request from your partner then this might be a case of delayed or impaired ejaculation 

When did this delay start Has it always been the case Or did it start recently 
Do you notice the delay during all sexual situations All partners or just someone in particular What about when you masturbate
Are you on any medications or drugs prescribed or social use eg marijuanaweed tramadol etc Or do you have any other symptoms Are you under any kind of stress lately Do you consume a lot of alcohol 

Therapy andor sexual counselling is most helpful in the absence of physical illnesses It  can help address underlying mental health problems if any that may result in delayed ejaculation and provide options to na sexual anxiety

Did you change your bathing soap recently or your body cream and other skin care products Did you travel anywhere or change your source of bathing water Are you aware of any allergies you might have either to food or drugs

EDD expected delivery date can only give you an approximate due date counting from the first day of your last menstrual period It can not give you a conception date EGA estimated gestational age on the other hand can roughly give you the age of the fetus also counting from the first day of your last menstrual period An ultrasound scan done early in the first trimester before 10weeks is usually the most accurate in dating a pregnancy

Theres no reason you should be getting lumps or bumps every time you get a haircut It is possible you get a reaction to something used while cutting your hair or even the clippers I hope you own the clippers used and you dont share with others 

That being said I will advise you to discontinue the antiinflammatory cream since its not working and especially now that the skin is broken

Sorry about what you are experiencing It could as a result of a number of things including hormonal imbalance and seeing a dermatologist if it persists is the best way to proceed  However you can get some over the counter acne medications from a reputable pharmacy Speak to the pharmacist for medications like 25 benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin gel which can be applied twice daily and wash skin with Dove bar Also drink a lot of water   

Dont forget that if it persists you should see a dermatologist If you need help finding one you can request via this form

1074,5,Infections,A friend of mine is having virginal cyst what actually leads to it and how can it be cured,22,90,[en:0.9999959215294099],"Hello there and thanks for using Wellvis
Youve done a good job trying to clarify what is going on with your friend 
Cysts in general are growths in the body that may contain fluid air or other substances They usually are benign that is do not lead to cancer
In the vagina these can be from birth trauma to the vagina surgery child birth or obstructions of glands There are usually no symptoms associated with cysts other than the presence of the lump which may be uncomfortable Sometimes there may be pain while bathing or even during sexual intercourse The substance inside the cyst may become infected and develop into pus In some cases they may be cancerous though rare 
Most of these cysts do not require any treatment unless there is an increase in size it is disturbing daily activities or there is a chance of it being cancerous The most common treatment is surgery to remove the cyst and treatment of infections if any
My recommendation will be for your friend to visit a gynaecologist to confirm the presence of cyst and to assess whether there is any need for an intervention

Blood in phlegm is quite common in many minor illnesses of the upper respiratory tract and also in regards viral bronchitis Usually it isnt a sign of a serious problem especially if youre young and otherwise healthy ie no underlying issues

1087,5,Infections,Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily was recommended for me  for 2weeks after I complained to a doctor about a slight lump at the back of my head that didnt seem to reduce in size after application of a topical antibiotic cream I took the drug for 11days but I started noticing pain in my chest area and also pain while swallowing I googled the side effects of doxycycline and I saw that what I was experiencing might be oesopheageal ulcer so I stopped the drug on the 11th day Ive missed three doses now Im wondering whether it is wise to resume it as Im not even certain that the bump at the back of my head has reduced,138,615,[en:0.9999965905524739],"Hi 
Sorry about your experience Its important to consider if the lump at the back of your neck is reducing or not if it is not

Youve done a great job with giving detailed information regarding your problem First of all Ill urge you to stay calm and not panic
Diagnosis of breast cancer needs to be done by your doctor after examining the affected breast and surrounding regions and requesting the relevant tests
Also keep in mind that other conditions can cause the lump you experienced in your armpit which Im thinking is a lymph node An infection for example may cause that
Regarding the lump have you noticed any change in its size or texture since this incident
Ill recommend you get a full breast examination from your doctor who will advice properly

Generally women are more likely to develop UTIs than men because they have shorter urethra meaning that microbes have a shorter distance to travel to reach the bladder Women who are pregnant or menopausal also have an increased risk of developing urinary tract infections

Other causes of painful urination depending on your gender includes 
prostatitis  inflammation of the prostate gland
sexually transmitted infection STIs such as genital herpes gonorrhea or chlamydia
kidney stones have also been known to cause painful urination 

It is important to know what the exact cause is And then specific medication and preventive measures can be provided

underlying heart diseases electrolyte imbalances changes in the heart muscle
Irregular heart rhythms can also occur in normal healthy hearts

exercise stress smoking use of marijuana alcohol or some medications can also result in irregular heartbeats 

However it is important to know whether you sense these irregularities often and regularly or just once in a while Do they come after particular instances or just casually and all of a sudden 

If you have or feel the following symptoms continuously please contact your doctor for a check up palpitations a feeling of skipped heart beats pounding in the chest dizziness or feeling lightheaded fainting shortness of breath chest discomfort or generalised weakness or feeling very tired 

Treatment depends on the type and seriousness of your arrhythmia Some people with arrhythmias require no treatment For others treatments can include medication making lifestyle changes and undergoing surgical procedures

I understand your fears and worries 
Its only normal you have them 
However there has been some instances where we have children whose teeth dont come out early

Also the teeth may not be fully out through the gum pads yet but Im  sure therell be signs that the teeth are present and on their way out A dentist knows this
Thats probably why the last dentist you saw said you shouldnt worry
However if you still dont feel comfortable with that please feel free to  get a second opinion at another clinic
See another dentist
It all boils down to having a thorough  examination carried out on your baby

Your babys teeth should erupt fully into his or her mouth in a couple of weeks though if theres  nothing stopping them from coming out

There are a number of requirements before one qualifies for a VBAC First of all the reason for the first CS should not be a recurrent one For instance if the reason for the first CS was a small pelvis theres no point trying for a VBAC 
The duration between the date of your last CS and the date of conception of this pregnancy should not be less than 15 months because this increases the risk of a ruptured uterus 
Following your CS if there was any infection of the womb or of the wound it reduces the quality of the CS scar and a repeat CS would be advisable 
At 36 weeks of pregnancy your doctor will ask you to do a scan to measure babys weight and thickness of the CS Scar An Xray or CT Scan of the pelvis will also be done to see if it is adequate If all these parameters are okay you can then be scheduled for a VBAC 
It is important to note that in most centers you will be given a grace till 41weeks and 3 days to come in natural labor because induction of labor is not done routinely in women with previous CS

First thing I would advise you do is get a good Obstetrician to manage this pregnancy 

There are so many reasons surrounding the successful delivery after Caeserian section 
what was the reason for the first emergency CS was the leading twin breech a preterm contraction preterm rupture of membrane or a planned CS due to it being a precious baby as you have said If none of the reasons are recurring and theres no cause for you to have CS this time around then you have a chance of going for VBAC

Also the timing for VBAC also depends on many factors 
If your last delivery is a year ago and you are just pregnant now meaning youve got about 2021 months to the time of delivery you can go for a trial of VBAC if your Obstetrician agrees to it I hope this helps Congratulations once again",187,839,[en:0.9999954723847421]

1133,1,General Health,Have been having a discomforting pain in my throat could it be a sign of corona virus,19,85,[en:0.9999960827997351],"Hello 

Good evening Having a discomforting feeling in the throat is not a sign of corona virus Corona virus is typically characterized by a dry cough  fever and sometimes difficulty in breathing It is also accompanied by body aches and pains and sometimes diarrhea 

Aside the discomforting feeling are there any other symptoms 

It is also possible to have a state of heightened anxiety due to so much information moving around on social media concerning the virus some of which are untrue 

I suggest you follow news information from verified handles and channels like NCDC and Federal ministry of health or you can also chat a doctor here 

Observe the discomfort I am sure it will pass If it persists you might need to see a doctor 

Once again take a Deep breath and relax

I guess you are referring to the use of face masks during this COVID19 pandemic

 You are a healthy person with no respiratory symptoms like coughing or sneezing
 You are not in contact with or exposed to a suspected case of COVID19

If you do have to wear a face mask however it is important to
 Know how to wear it properly and how to dispose of it
 Combine wearing with proper hand hygiene by cleaning your hands with an alcoholbased hand sanitiser or with soap and water before and after using the mask
 Avoid touching the mask while you have it on

Sorry about what youre experiencing

When you say weakness do you mean exhausted like after doing exercise or unable to move at all
Is your wife your first sexual partner

Usually after orgasm and ejaculation theres a timeframe called the refractory period During that period you may feel a little tired from sexual activity and lazy However that should not stop you from carrying daily activities 

Some possible causes are
 Being tired before getting into the activity That couldve compounded with the energy spent during intercourse
 Maybe thé sexual activity was too vigorous Consider slowing down and you should derive the same pleasure
 You could be stressed and just need a good rest rather than sex at the time

If you are getting tired to the extent of not being able to do basic movements like walking then you should see your doctor for a check up 

We offer a live chat service here where you can communicate directly with one of our doctors The service is quite affordable and you are guaranteed to get the best help you need and a referral if needed

Good afternoon I suppose you are pregnant 
How many weeks are you or how far are you gone in your pregnancy
Is this your first pregnancy 
Normally as pregnancy advances we have an increase in gastric emptying which is caused by the pregnancy hormones This subsequently leads to bloating which can mimic the heaviness you feel 

To get some relief eat light meals in intervals and avoid heavy meals do some exercise regularly like taking walks If it is too much you can take osme antacids to help as you can aslo be suffering from indigestion

First I must say taking a drug without indication for it or a doctors prescription is not encouraged 
That said I suppose you took chloroquine as a measure against covid19 Chloroquine has not been found to provide protection against the virus or as a sole cure of the virus At best it has only been used as part of treatment therapy so there really isnt any reason to abuse the drug in panic
Also your symptom does not suggest you have the virus Many things could cause the headache like 
Not sleeping well
Stress even from travelling etc

So I would that you observe to eat well and rest 
Also practice high hygiene and social distancing If you notice any or more symptoms kindly reach out

Im sorry about the symptoms youre experiencing While managing it previously did you complete taking your medications Do you get relieved of the pain after eating Are you a smoker Are you conscious of your diet 

Certain factors can exacerbate peptic ulcer or prevent them from healing Taking painkillers like diclofenac and ibuprofen are known to worsen ulcer Drinks containing alcohol caffeine milk orange juices and red pepper should be avoided in an ulcer patient 

Also eat at least two hours before going to bed and take small frequent meals rather than large meals 
Include fruits and vegetables in your diet avoid stress drink enough water get enough sleep and dont smoke

1156,5,Infections,I usually feel  itching once in a while  in my private parts even  few days to my periodswht could be the cause,27,111,[en:0.9999967733968398],"Hi 

Itching of the genitals can be a symptoms of many diseases from vaginal infections and STIs to allergies and irritation 

Therefore it is important to find if there are additional symptoms like discharge pain during urination or sex rashes or significant discolouration etc 

In the meantime ensure to practice good genital area hygiene by ensuring that after using the toilet you wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from the anus getting into the vagina Also avoid chemical products such as douches or feminine hygiene sprays which can upset the acidic balance of the vagina
Avoid scented feminine hygiene products to prevent irritation

Firstly  dentists really do not like to take out a tooth that can be saved
Secondly Its actually for your safety that youve been told to return for the filling
At this stage from the little history Ive gathered youll  most likely need  a somewhat complex  treatment to fix the issue

 Nowbecause of the Corona Pandemic  dentists are being careful to drill a tooth and carry out elective procedures 
 because we are at the forefront we deal with aerosols and this can help spread droplets  leading to infection of the patient and even the dentist Nurse  However  dental emergencies such as yours are being attended to 
So you could go back to the clinic or check somewhere else and ask for a temporary  filling that wont  require drilling to give some form of relief
Medications may not help so much  until the problem  is sorted Then meds will be given 

Ethically wise in medicine Im  not allowed to prescribe  any meds without physical contact with the patient so my best advise still remains that you go back to that clinic or check another clinic thats  still open 

I hope this helps and that you take  action fast so you can feel better soon

Whats your age and gender 
Also do these symptoms happen after sex too or just in masturbation  Sounds like a lot of things happen when you masturbate Not exactly sure how they are all tie together but if you are certain they only occur after masturbation have you ever considered stopping it

1218,1,General Health,What can cause inability to gain weight even after using different multivitamins,15,80,[en:0.9999955196522808],"Hello Joy and thanks for using Wellvis 

Sorry about your concern

Weight gain just like weight loss is a also a challenge for some

Before I go further please ensure you have no medical condition thats responsible for your inability to gain weight That will need to be addressed first with a doctor

You can gain weight healthily and gradually You just need consistency and patience A few tips I will give are

 Eating slightly more calories than you do This doesnt have to be junk food but healthy foods which are feeling and which you like Preferably protein and healthy carbohydrates 

 Consider snacking in between meals This may also include healthy food options without compromising your overall health

 Take up weightlifting exercises This could be body weight exercises like squats and lunges at home or using equipment in your local gym These will help bulk up your muscle mass and your weight in total

 Another tip which you may consider is just loving yourself as you are Our body sizes are related to our genetics too So if thats your genetic makeup you could chose to just embrace it and enjoy every moment But thats purely your decision as long as youre happy with it

Hope this helps",233,1201,[en:0.9999965302012592]

Please what symptoms do you have exactly Any persistent vaginal discharge Persistent abdominal pain Changes in urination  Any significant menstraul abnormalities Was the diagnosis confirmed with a Pelvic scan Did you do an Endocervical  HV Swab test How long ago was this done
We have to be sure its a PID alone  what organism is causing this symptom In order to treat appropriately 

In the mean time avoid Douching use of vaginal wash etc Best to avoid intercourse now but if you must use a condom screen yourself for other Sexually transmitted in infections eg HIV Syphyllis Hep B C
If the pain is so severe a pain reliever like Ibuprofen 1 tablet after meal may be used

Weight gain is relative  dependent on a number of factors eg foods you eat genetics level of physical activity medicationsdrug use etc

The multivitamin you mentioned would only increase appetite but not necessarily make you gain weight

Protein Rich foods would grossly increase  muscle bulk whilst Fried foods  Simple sugarsCarbs would increase Body fat

I can relate with what youre experiencing because Im on that journey myself and its quite a challenge but fulfilling Ive knocked off almost 30kg and hoping to lose more

Theres a lot of good advice out there on how to go about weight loss but what I think shows the most success is making it a lifestyle change This means Making healthy food choices and choosing a sustainable exercise regimen These need to be things you love and can keep up without getting bored

But its also important to ensure that your excess weight is not due to any medical condition as it will require more than diet and exercise

I will recommend the following
 That you reducecut out any processed foods and do more of fresh meals So say bye to any fast foods and make an effort to cook your own meals
 Reducing sugar alone or sugar containing products is proven to show some reduction in weight 
 Reduce your portions gradually and take a lot of water Sometimes we think we are hungry and all we need to do is drink water
 While indoors there are so many video resources and apps for home workouts You can start with a low intensity workout routine and gradually work your way up to a higher intensity

These recommendations are a few of many and we will be glad to give you more through the live chat 

You can do it and hopefully you will do it

I hope this helps",285,1386,[en:0.9999966525880197]

First of all it is important to establish a few things with you about the hymen It is a thin piece of tissue that surrounds the vagina not quite covering it as most people believe It might interest you to know that some people are born without a hymen and that the hymen usually gets thinner as you grow

While like you have pointed out some cultures use the presence of the hymen as a determinant for virginity it is important for you to know that simple activities like riding a bicycle or climbing trees can be responsible for hymenal tearing Basically the presence or absence of a hymen does not imply sexual activity
The hymen may bleed when it tears but that does not always happen 

It is understandable that your fears are grounded in your cultural beliefs however it is important to try to engage parentsfamily members with discussions such as why hymenal tearing is not linked to sexual activity Please try to be tactful with this conversation or otherwise avoid it if your parentsguardians may physically assault you

It is also important to when you get in a relationship have this kind of conversation with your partner Please be open about your sexual activity with them too

As you have mentioned that you have never engaged in sexual activity prior to this kindly ensure to use protection ie condoms to keep yourself from sexually transmitted infections

On a final note your religion or culture may frown at masturbation but your personal inclinations might be otherwise In that case please be careful about the kind of objects you use for your pleasure Avoid objects with sharp or pointy ends or not at all made for the purpose of masturbation You can use your fingers but ensure they are clean and your nails are trimmed

Please stay safe in this pandemic

Its understandable that you feel stressed now given your hopes regarding your sexuality
A virgin is someone who has never had sexual intercourse however virginity is beginning to mean different things to different people The hymen is a membranous lining found at the vaginal opening it may take different forms and could be absent in some women It can break through various means and may even stretch out over time You may notice some blood at the point when the hymen is broken

Please note that for most the traditional meaning of virginity still obtains which is the absence of penovaginalpenoanal sexual intercourse Going by this you are still a virgin

However while masturbating might not result in a hymen breaking I will advise that you visit a hospital close to you so that your vaginal area can be examined by a nurse or doctor who will check if your hymen is still intact

This sounds like a case of chronic back pain The history and physical examination are the first step in the evaluation and management of low back pain therefore you might have to see an orthopaedic surgeon andor a physiotherapist to rule out serious conditions 

Meanwhile you can keep your back healthy and strong by engaging in regular lowimpact exercises that dont strain your back It can increase strength and endurance in your back and allow your muscles to function better Walking and swimming are good choices this also allows you to build abdominal and back muscles which strengthen your core to serve as a natural corset for your back
You must also maintain a healthy weight as being overweight strains back muscles If youre overweight trimming down can prevent back pain
Quit smoking if you presently smoke 

Standing sitting and lifting heavy object in a more backprotective way will go a long way towards protecting your back

Sorry about what you are experiencing and I hope I can provide some good counsel

What you have described sounds like a posterior fourchette frenulum injury which could likely be a fissure or tear Just as you described it can result from sexual intercourse and in some instances inflammation or infection Though this tends to resolve after some time as you mentioned it can be recurrent too like your case 

My recommendation will be halting sexual intercourse to allow some healing and while you do that visit a gynaecologist to examine the affected area A decision on what is the right treatment can then be done It could require surgical repair or not depending on the extent of the damage

If and when you return to sexual intercourse I will recommend that you and your partner discuss about this so that you both enjoy the experience His thrustings should be gentle and not vigorous Also consider assuming positions that do not make penetration challenging Using lubricants can also offer some benefits

I advise you to make out time to see a doctor for proper evaluation and investigation  xray of the back In the meantime you can take some analgesics like paracetamol to ease the pain Get ergonomically designed seats for use if your bed is too soft you can change it 

I hope this helps 

Get well soon You can chat with a doctor for a detailed workup

1303,8,Skin Care,Hello I have had this itchy and sometimes painful rashes for 4 months now I saw a dermatologist who advised I use dove soap as the ph level is low and good for sensitive skin After 6 weeks of using dove and moisturizing the rashes are still coming on and off  on different parts of the body I have used antibiotics and prednisone as recommended by a pharmacist All to no avail The rashes are back with a vengeance all through my fingers toes breast arms and thighs a few days after I finished the drugs I dont know what is going on I forgot to mention my husband also has similar complaints and we are the only two living in the house,133,634,[en:0.999997989590209],"Hello 
Good morning I suggest that you seek a  second review with the dermatologist or another one 
You might be having some form of allergy In the meantime please stop all medications including the antibiotics and prednisolone They might actually worsen it 

Take a lot of water eat fruits bath at least twice a day use vaseline as it is skin neutral till you get a review from a dermatologist 

I hope this helps

It is important to note that it is always best to comply to medical instruction  If you have been giving a medical treatment and you are responding well to it you need to complete your medications so that you can be completely well and dont experience a relapse Also when drugs are not completed it can lead to the infectious organism forming resistance against such drugs resistant strains thereby rendering the drugs ineffective when in future useKindly complete your medications
Concerning the odour if it is from your inside it is probably perceived when you breathe out Recommence the drugs again and ensure that you take water liberally generously so that you can easily and timely eliminate the end product of the drugs that is circulating in your blood This way you wont have to perceive the odour of the drugs for long or in an unpleasant way Thank you",165,883,[en:0.9999961466512162]

Thank you for using Wellvis

Vaginal discharge may be normal or abnormal

Normal causes of vaginal discharge include pregnancy ovulation exercise etc The abnormal causes could be by bacteria yeast and other organisms pathogens Cancer of the cervix opening of the womb may also cause vaginal discharge 

This means that no vaginal discharge should be taken to be ordinary until the doctor says so

Each cause of vaginal discharge can be differentiated by its distinctive colour or smell A note of its consistency should also be noted

However the description you gave of the vaginal discharge with respect to its colour and odour shows it is most likely an abnormal vaginal discharge

More details about the discharge is therefore required from you 

This would aid in identifying the cause and the appropriate treatment to apply

Welcome to Wellvis 

This question is a very common one by young women most especially after childbirth They are usually bothered about reduced sexual satisfaction for them and their partner

There are different ways of tightening the vagina but it is worthy of note that drugs and herbal extracts being advertised everywhere for vaginal tightening does not have a scientific basis for its cure but may even cause more damage to the body

The most reliable remedy for vaginal tightening is Kegels exercises

Kegels are actually effective for toning the pelvic floor decreasing incontinence and improving sexual satisfaction

Kegel exercises involve tightening the muscles of your pelvic floor in several sets of repetitions throughout the day 

These are the same muscles you would use to stop urine flow If you do Kegels you will improve the strength and tone of your pelvic floor whether or not you take vaginal tightening pills 

Finally there are surgical procedures to improve vagina tightness but these are usually used as the last resort

Its not uncommon for women to experience unusual vaginal discharge The description you have given above may suggest a yeast infection but with the abnormal odour one will need to clarify a few more details The good news is that they are treatable

In Nigeria termination of pregnancy is criminal except when performed by a doctor when the health and life of the mother is at risk if the pregnancy is allowed to continue Another reason for medical termination of pregnancy is when the baby is malformed in the womb

In your question you didnt tell us if the cytotec you used was prescribed by a doctor or not and for which reason

Furthermore the feeling of weakness you experienced could be from excessive blood loss leading to anemialow blood levels

Please see a doctor for further evaluation and treatment

All the best",154,744,[en:0.9999959427394303]

Thanks for your question
Menses could be delayed for a number of reasons including stress hormonal issues and so on While cycle lengths can range from 21 to 35 days it appears that you are quite familiar your own cycle length

Since have noticed spots of blood this may be an indication of your menses resuming or possibly of what is called implantation bleeding This bleeding often occurs 714 days after conception as the fertilized egg gets attached to the wall of the uterus Other things to consider will be possible infections or use of contraceptives

However the easiest thing for you to do at this point will be to do urine pregnancy in the morning

I will also advise that you book a private chat with one of the doctors who will ask you a few other specific questions and help guide you through 

I hope you find this helpful

1335,1,General Health,I have a big lemon plus sweet sized and red haemorrhoid by my anus A bit painful Any advice,23,91,[en:0.9999972695470463],"Hello there and thanks for using Wellvis

Sorry about what you are experiencing

How long have you had this for How often do you pass stool Are you experiencing any bleeding when passing stool What is the consistency of your stool Do you have to strain when passing stool Do you sit on the toilet for too long

Haemorrhoids are usually easy to manage at home However you should visit the doctor if it starts bleeding you notice changes in your stool colour and consistency as well as other symptoms like dizziness which may be linked to blood loss from the bleeding haemorrhoid

Some lifestyle modifications will be
 Eating high fibre foods like fruits which will make passage of stool easier and reduce your chances of being constipated this will also help avoid straining
 Exercising or being active helps with bowel movements and thus reduces the chances of constipation
 Drink a lot of water and fluids
 Avoid sitting in the toilet for long as this puts pressure on the veins responsible for forming haemorrhoids Maybe try avoiding the use of your mobile phone while you are using the toilet as this is a common reason for prolonged toilet use
 Avoid lifting heavy weights

For treatment
 Immerse your anal region in warm water for 1015 minutes two to three times a day using sitz bath bath tub or a large basin depending on what is available
 Some creams or ointments like Anusol can offer some relief
 You can take oral painkillers But remember to see your doctor as the pain worsens

You should be able to experience some relief and improvement of symptoms with these recommendations

Child abuse and molestation is an offence viewed from different perspectives in different countries especially on the basis of the age Usually the older child usually a teenager is the culprit or initiator but the there is usually an underlying reason why they indulge in this behaviour Some countries treat it as a crime while others do not

However my advice will be to get the children to a child psychotherapist or counselor so as to curtail the chances of this recurring Also providing them with a healthy environment at home will have a great impact this you can do by continually engaging them in daily home activities and making sure those living with them and the media cartoons movies they consume have a positive influence

Sorry to hear about your struggles with vaginal infections

There are several types of possible infections eg vaginal candidiasis yeast infection bacterial vaginosis trichomonas pelvic inflammatory disease Often times there may be coexistence of more than one

The treatments will differ depending on the specific diagnosis and in some cases the sexual partner also needs to be treated to prevent reinfection

It will be best for you to talk to a doctor to fully understand why you are having Tremors  Neurovite is a multivitamin drug and in a lot of cases does not treat anything specifically  I am not sure of what Actave is but i believe that talking at length with a doctor will give you more clarity on the issue and what next steps that might benefit you

1 Do you feel a sharp pain when breathing in
2 Are you breathless when you are at rest or when working or moving
3 How long does the pain and breathlessness last
 Among others

A good examination of your chest will also help narrow down your diagnosis 
Tests to check the state of the organs in your chest need to be done
Do well to visit a hospital for proper check

Congratulations on your pregnancy What is visualized in a pregnancy scan depends among other things on the type of ultrasound done A transvaginal scan TVS is done through the vagina and is usually able to have a closer look at pelvic structures as is seen during a early pregnancy A transabdominal scan TAS is done by placing the ultrasound probe on the abdomen to view structures In order to help get a better view of pelvic structures in transabdominal scan you may be asked to have a full bladder drink lots of water get pressed but do not urinate

In a transvaginal scan it is possible to see a yolk sac within the gestational at about 5 and a half weeks while it may be around 7 weeks for a transabdominal scan So again it will be important to know the type of scan that you had done

Again because most of the estimates are also based statistics it is important to note that one can not be hard and fast on these dates
My suggestion will be that you consider repeating an ultrasound in about 2 weeks from the previous 

In the meantime it will be good to ensure you are registered in a facility that can provide you with optimum antenatal services Should you notice any bleed do not hesitate to present to your primary care provider We will also be glad to answer any other questions or concerns you may have

I hope you found these few lines helpful Should you need more information do not hesitate to use the private chat option to speak with a doctor of your choice

You must be really worried However I dont think there is a problem or you have a complication of any kind Normally following conception the babys growth is in stagesyou said you are 6weeks and 5days gone what was seen during the ultrasound scan was the embryonic sac with probably what is called the foetal pole thats like a very early stage of your babys growth  You need not worry if you have no other complaints however you can visit another facility for a repeat ultrasound but I will advice you wait for some time maybe a week or two and then repeat the ultrasound scan

Thank you for using Wellvis Urinary tract infections UTIs are broadly classified into upper tract and lower tract UTIs The lower tract involves the bladder and the urethra while the upper tract involves the kidneys and ureters Treatment options and duration differ based on the specific type of UTI A few more specific questions can help tease out the type you may have

It is also important not just to treat a urinary tract infection but to also endeavour to know what predisposed the person to it in order to prevent future recurrences 

Women are generally more easily predisposed to UTIs because the urethra in women is relatively short Some of the factors that may predispose men to UTIs include poor urine outflow from prostate enlargement or urethral strictures urinary tract stones or sexually transmitted infections

Thank you for your question A ketogenic diet keto diet for short is a low carbohydrate high fat fat diet Normally the body uses carbohydrate as fuel for energy When the body is deprived of carbohydrate it is forced to burn fat as fuel and in the process release ketone bodies which the cells now use for energy Because fat is being burned as the primary source of fuel this diet promotes weight loss

Keto diet was originally developed to help with children with seizure disorders close to a century ago It has been thought to be helpful in a number of other health conditions but more research is still needed to ascertain these
However it is also important to realize that it is not without its side effects The ketone bodies have a tendency to make the body more acidic acidosis There is also a risk of development of kidney stones Other possible side effects are fatigue headache low blood sugar indigestion etc

So if you are considering starting a ketogenic diet please discuss with your doctor first especially if you have any underlying health condition It will also be helpful that you undergo this under the guidance of a registered dietitian

It is important to realize that while loosing weight is important for your health you should also do it a way that promotes your overall well being

Should you want further counselling on weight loss please consider the private chat option with any of our doctors

while it is possible to recurrent boils in the anal region what you have described sounds a bit more like a condition called fistulainano or anal fistula In anal fistulas there is usually a tunnel that opens on two sides one near skin and another near the end of your bowel Often times people notice only the outer opening but are unable to see the one that is deeper within anus Because it is a tunnel with 2  openings no amount of antibiotics will likely close it Usually one will require treatment that will close up the tunnel or open it up and allow it to heal

While it is possible for pelvic infections to cause irregular menses it is usually not from Candida I am also a bit concerned that you have been on treatment for Candida since the beginning of the year Thats quite a long time as the treatments usually have specified course and duration  There are certainly several other types of pelvic infections aside candida It will be useful t help you explore these

Please do consider having a private chat with any of our doctors to help you explore most likely cause in your case
I hope this helps

If you blood pressure is consistently within the range of 140145mmHg then it is obvious that you are have high blood pressure 

The next steps now will be to speak to a family physician who will examine you and also request some tests in a bid to know exactly what the cause is Once this has been identified you will be advised on ways to reduce and stabilise it through lifestyle modifications however you might also be prescribed some medications to help control it if required

Painful sex can be caused by a number of reasons such as physical changes infection or psychological stress or trauma Painful sex can also be as a result of inadequate lubrication

Seizures are an emergency sign in children and the child needs to be seen by a doctor They usually arise from different conditions which could be metabolic like low blood sugar infectious like malaria or meningitis chronic illnesses like epilepsy or others like trauma

Depending on what is causing the seizure that will determine the treatment Some treatments do not require anticonvulsants but treatment of the underlying condition like giving glucose in low blood sugar Some treatments may have to be life long to improve the quality of life in conditions like epilepsy

It is also important if the child is having recurrent seizures to identify any triggers like flashing lights loud noise hunger etc as well as any factors or conditions related to the seizures Another thing to note is to keep the child away from a harmful environment like flames stairs and being unattended depending on the age

What you are experiencing is normal and I implore you not to feel embarrassed about it You are having wet dreams which happens to almost every man and could be more frequent with others They are called wet dreams because of the ejaculation that occurs usually after an erotic dream

Your sexual attraction towards the opposite sex too is normal but you will need to learn to control your urges so the lady does not feel harrassed 

You can try and have discussions that are less erotic or sexually suggestive 

You can also try to meet her in the midst of others or in public so as to avoid resorting to any behaviour she may find inappropriate 

Depending on your cultural or spiritual beliefs you could consider indulging in masturbation to ease the built up sexual tension 

Keeping yourself busy may help take your mind off any sexual thoughts

Hopefully soon you can have a partner and be able to enjoy regular intimacy

Thank you for using Wellvis 

The issue of sleep disorders in the elderly is very broad as causes vary significantly Understanding the exact cause can sometimes be time consuming but the results are always worth it 

Considering it is a long standing issue as stated by you it is important that she gets a general health review preferably from a physician or a geriatrician which will include understanding her medical history concomitant medications she may be on physical examination lab tests etc A mental status examination will also be required to rule out underlying psychological stress or disorders following retirement existing health problems death of loved ones etc 

Also she might be required to keep a sleep diary and a sleep study may be requested 

Overall it is important that the underlying issue be identified as soon as possible and any accompanying illness be treated or managed Over the counter sleep medications can become abused or not work as before once tolerance is built and most importantly can have adverse effect when used with some other medications 

Pending her review with a family physician some helpful tips include 
limiting liquid before bed avoiding caffeine and alcohol eating three to four hours before bedtime light exercising regularly taking a warm bath to relax etc

I empathise with what your son is going through and hopefully my response here offers some help

Did he use a common blade at the barbers shop Is this the first time its happening Have you noticed any bumps on his head

What you have described sounds like folliculitis sometimes called Barbers itch It is an infection of the hair follicles usually from poorly sterilised shaving equipment The infection could be from bacteria fungi or viruses in some cases It normally resolves in about two weeks with just home management However if poorly treated could have complications

Ill recommend you wash his head and put a warm moist cloth or towel over it after that Depending on the causative organism you can apply an antibacterial or antifungal cream or ointment

To prevent this from recurring consider purchasing hair clippers for his personal use If this cannot be done ensure that the barber cleans and sterilises his machine properly before using on his head

The feeling of numbness and tingling in the hands and legs is known as paresthesia and because its been going on for about two years this is considered chronic paresthesia which is often a sign of nerve damage peripheral neuropathy 

There are different causes of peripheral neuropathy diabetes kidney disease infections poisoning etc are some of the known causes 

The severity and frequency of the paresthesia depends on the cause therefore it is important to find the exact cause oftentimes treating the underlying cause eliminates the continuous numbness and tingling sensation The earlier the underlying cause is identified and management commenced the less likely potentially lifelong consequences can develop

Sorry about the aesthetic discomfort youre experiencing and hopefully my reply can offer you some reassurance

From your description of the event it appears that your body healed itself by hypertrophy swelling Unfortunately it cannot be modified by application of creams or ointments as it now functions as a normal part of your body Which leaves the only possible solution Im aware of to be surgical correction by a plastic surgeon

However if I may ask further are you experiencing any physical discomfort like pain difficulty talking eating etc Also are you getting teased mocked or made fun of If yes you should see a doctor to assess the implications the physical impediment And for the social stigma if this is happening within a formal setting school or work inform the relevant authority

Ill encourage you to talk about it with someone you trust a family member or a friend  That may help you be much more comfortable with it and may in turn inspire someone else who faces the same Youve done a great job living with it for 6 years and my guess is your immediate circle of interaction do not see you as any different than before the incident

Sorry about this ordeal

Depending on your location the formalities may differ but the approach is usually the same The main things Ill recommend will be

  The victim should report to the police station so that the chase for the perpetrator is initiated 

 Visit thé hospital for examination of the genital and anal areas to document any signs of forced entry Here also a screen for sexually transmitted infections needs to be done 

 For female victims abortion services may be offered depending on local laws Since its been 2 weeks the emergency contraceptive pill will be of no benefit

 Counseling and therapy sessions need to be started for the victim to mitigate the mental health effects of the rape You can look up institutions or organisations focused on rape in your area and contact them

 At thé family and community level moral support should be provided to the victim Keeping the victims name undisclosed is important in avoiding stigmatization

Good morning Sorry to read about your ordeal However a few questions are important to clearly establish what might be wrong with your arm 

When did the pain start
Which of the arms is affected
How old are you
Are you hypertensive or diabetic
What kind of work do you do
Are you on any medications

Answers to some of these questions can give some clue I suggest that you private chat a doctor for a detailed history and examination 

In the interim you can take some paracetamol to ease the pain

 Change in cervical fluid  the Cervical fluid that resembles egg whites is a sign you are near ovulation or are ovulating 
 Change in basal body temperature  Your body temperature suddenly rises around the period Tracking your basal body temperature accurately over a few months can help you predict fertile period
 Breast tenderness
 Abdominal bloating
 Increased sex drive
 A heightened sense of smell taste or vision

Im not sure what you mean by transparency in the figures 
Do you have a particular reason for doubting the numbers as they are presently Maybe that will be a better way of asking the question

You seem to have reached a conclusion on being addicted to sex was this a diagnosis given by a doctor or you only believe that you are addicted to sex based on your urges and cravings  Compulsive sexual behaviours will require a detailed conversation with a doctor and subsequently with a sex therapist to provide the diagnosis and treatment options 

Meanwhile I do not know how easy it will be to ask the lady to go get tested against her will therefore that might be a dead end 
My advice is that you visit a clinic for voluntary HIV counselling and testing and to continue to practice safe sex if you are unable to abstain completely 

PS examination of the genitals of a sexual partner hardly ever reveals the HIV status or sexual health of the said partner

First I would want to congratulate you for opening up and requesting the need to be helped 
The issue of sexual addiction has to be addressed on several levels
The Spiritual level has to be dealt with get to a spiritual leader or a pastor you could confide in and let him help you you should also know that you are not condemned by God for reaching out 

Healthwise its unhealthy to keep on such sexual lifestyle without restraints  because you are at risk  of contracting HIV syphilis  gonorrhea  chlamydia and you stand a risk of penile cancer from HPV infection and several others 
I would advise Total Abstinence though you might not achieve it at once  but let that be your goal

1419,10,Dental Health,Can chronic halitosis be cured permarnently ,11,44,[en:0.9999976846952606],"Hello there
Also known as mouth odorhalitosis could be an embarassing condition to the sufferer and the diagnosis can be quite tricky to the dentistIt can be classified into True halitosis  and Psychogenic halitosisfalse halitosis in which the person just feels he has mouth odor even when nobody has ever told him his mouth was smelling
Having said thatthere are  a couple of likely causes of true halitosis and these determine the chronicity of the conditionSome of the possible causes include
1Poor oral hygieneA heavy presence of plaque and calculusyellowish to dark colored deposits on the teeth in the mouth will cause mouth odorAlso nonbrushing or improper brushing of the tongue is a major cause of halitosisThe tongue is the largest reservoir of food debris in the mouth hence not brushing the tongue is like not brushing at all
2Diets Frequent concsumption of onionsgarlicbeans and other food which produce Volatile sulphur compoundsVSCThese VSCs play a major role in dietasociated halitosis
3Systemic diseases like Chronic Kidney diseaseGastroesophageal reflux disordersGERD can also cause halitosis
Alsohalitosis is associated with eating disorders like Bulimia nervosa where people engage in acts of  intentionally inducing vomitting of food ingestedBesides some people engage in the habit of regurgitating ingested food and this could also lead to mouth odor

Based on all I  have stated abovethe best way to diagnose halitosis would be for you to visit a dentistThe dentist will have to examine your mouth thoroughly and evaluate the possible causes of the halitosis in your case
Have you ever had scaling and polishing  It is very possible the chronic halitosis in your case is because you have never visited the dentistScaling and polishing is a procedure which is meant to be done every six months  at leastand this is a way to clear the cobwebs in our mouthsthe plaque and calculus which I mentioned earlier

Bloating is usually caused by excess gas in the stomach due to your diet or based on disturbances in the movement along the digestive system Considering its been present for over a year I doubt its anything too serious However it is important to ask about your dietary history presence of abdominal pain or any other associated symptoms such as duration and frequency of passing gas and bowel movements characteristics of your stool presence of blood in your stool weight loss if its worsened by a particular meal or not etc

Good morning Ideally one should not see blood during sex It is not normal However there are a couple of possibilities as to why this can be happening 
First is there is the possibility of a sexually transmitted infection going on Then it can also be what we call a cervical polyps Most commonly cases of vaginal dryness If there is poor lubrication before penetration it can lead to painful sex bruising and subsequently bleeding

Good morning I suggest that you go for a blood pregnancy test which is usually more informative and reliable than the urine test 

Most importantly you should do a pelvic ultrasound scan This will reveal if there is any retained products or a live gestational sac 

Bear in mind that even after an abortion or termination of pregnancy the pregnancy test will still be positive even after a week or two 

You can chat a doctor privately with the results of your tests

1430,12,Women's Health,I have seen my period for more than 2 weeks  now I dont experience any unusual pain Please is it normal,22,103,[en:0.9999968943377004],"Hello Sorry about that

Any period that lasts beyond the normal days is abnormal The fact that you dont feel pain doesnt mean you should ignore it Something sinister may just be going on in there It is also possible that youre hormones are at an abnormal level The fact that you are also losing blood without replacement calls for concern

It would help if you find out the cause of the bleeding by visiting a gynaecologist who will examine you and order some tests for you in order to determine the cause and definite treatment

It may just be urgent

1431,1,General Health,Pls how can a 20years old stop bedwetting,12,41,[en:0.9999985368418864],"Hi
Im going to ask you some follow up questions to have a better understanding of whats going on
Have they ever been bed wetting or did they have a period of dryness then began to bedwet again Are they on medication for any condition During the day do they contain themselves well
Its important to see a doctor so as to have them examined and if need be run some tests to exclude the possibility of infections and other underlying conditions that might lead to the bedwetting 
Meanwhile keep an otimistic attitude and motivate them Dont let them feel bad about it or punish them
Encourage them to void when they wake up every few hours say 2hrs and discourage them from holding urine to the last minute 
They should drink just enough fluids throughout the day so as to maintain adequate hydration as well as not feel thirsty in the evening which could lead them to drink excessive amounts before bed and bedwetting
Take them to the washroom before bedtime If after 3 months these measures dont result in dryness medication or using an alarm at night will help

1433,14,Eye Health,My baby of 1yr 3monthd has a squint The opthamologist we saw has been checking him doing tests but hasnt given him any drug or eye drop Can squint be treated,40,157,[en:0.999995534362595],"Hello there
Sorry about baby It was a good call to have him reviewed by an ophalmologist as the treatment will depend on what is discovered during the assessment of the affected eyes as well as tests done
If the squint is of sudden onset it could point to causes like a recent disease process eg infections A longstanding squint could be as a result of eg developmental abnormalities of the eye muscles and its nerves or diseases that weaken the eye muscles among others
The ophthalmologist therefore has to assess the babys vision to see if its reduced or not his eye movements to assess the strength of the eye muscles and to even check the inside of the eye by use of an instrument
Now the treatment will depend on whats discovered If there is an underlying disease causing the squint whether inside the eye or not it is the disease that will be treated If he has decreased vision in the affected eyes that will be corrected too There is also role for surgery which aims to improve cosmetic appearance and to tighten or loosen the eye muscles

This is a legitimate concern however we are unable to know exactly what is wrong without more information and preferably some tests 

My advice is that you get some basic tests at the lab such as a malaria parasite test Meanwhile have you checked your blood pressure lately are you under any new kind of stress are you eating well and staying hydrated are you sleeping well any similar occurence in the past do you wear glasses and have you recently visited your optician or changed your glasses on a scale of 1  10 how would you rate the pain and what do you do when its most severe how do you relieve it are you on any routine medication and quite important to ask during this time have you been exposed to someone who has been confirmed COVID19 positive or do you have any other symptoms check httpsselfassessmentncdcgovng

One of the first things to consider is if this happens with a particular soap you use or with all soaps If it happens with a particular soap best approach will be to stop that particular soap and use something else Also some soaps are harsh and you might be better served using milder soaps like regular toilet soaps  If this happens with all soaps then you might reconsider the water you use especially if it is a recent event The bottomline is for you to try to be sure of what triggers or triggered the itch and do your best to avoid it

Depending on the rate of your metabolism gaining weight or losing it can be quite tricky However if you eat and drink more calories than your body expends you should gain more weight 

Therefore it is paramount that you increase your caloric intake to improve your chances of weight gain

Whew it is indeed a long and detailed question 

So heres the thingthere are still quite a lot of things not known about COVID however its unlikely you couldnt smell without noticing it especially of you didnt notice any change in your sense of taste Meanwhile these complications as you have mentioned are not the most common ones therefore arent very common 
Its possible for one to get stressed over  ones exposure or about a lot of these nondescript complaints 

Brain complications is very vague and although neurological symptoms from COVID exist they are usually in the form of headaches confusion and less commonly stokes 

My advice really to you is to stop worrying about unlikely brain complications of a disease you dont even know for a fact if your havehad however ensure you continue to wear a mask when out in the public practice social distancing and maintain hand hygiene

Some of the most common reasons for frequently clearing the throat include laryngopharyngeal reflux usually when stomach contents travel upwards causing a discomfort in the throat or allergies Sometimes it could just be due to a tic which is an uncontrollable reaction 

More questions need to be asked about your weight age gender dietary and past medical history to be able to pinpoint and rule out possible causes

Bilateral breasts swelling with associated nipple discharge How long have you noticed the swelling Is it permanent or it comes and goes What is the colour and consistency of the discharge Are you pregnant or recently pregnant Does it come out on its own or do you have to squeeze the nipple for it to come out Are you in any medications Are there any physical changes besides the swelling in your breasts change in the way your nipple or the skin of the breasts look 

Regarding the pain hormones are the number one suspects when it comes to breast pain especially if it occurs three to five days prior to your period Is there any history of trauma to the breasts

The other listed symptoms may be associated with the breast symptoms or not however answers to the above listed questions can provide guidance towards reaching a cause 
You can have a private chat with a doctor here for advice on what to do next and how to treat or prevent the pains in the future

1501,1,General Health,Pls am having pains in both of my ribs what can it be,14,53,[en:0.999994194701502],"Hello 

The rib cage consists of 24 ribs 12 on either side shielding the vital organs of the chest including the heart and the lungs from damage Not sure which rib in particular you are referring to 

However pain in the ribs can be due to musculoskeletal issues following blunt trauma to the area from falling or being punched in the chest or sides Lung and pleura infections may also cause chest  rib pains 

Can you describe the pain is it worse with breathing What other symptoms are there 

Visit a doctor if you continue to feel the pain in the absence of any underlying injury as this can be the precursor to a more serious issue 
Meanwhile you can get some over the counter pain medications to help relieve the pain or speak privately to a doctor her on Wellvis for advice on the next steps

Sorry about your experience There is nothing wrong in feeding your baby with formula if you are not producing enough breast milk You just need to ensure that you are giving him enough of the formula as it is appropriate for his age You should feed the child as much as possible so if you are not feeding him well he wont gain weight as appropriate If you are feeding him well and he is not gaining weight then there might be another underlying factor and you should take the child to the hospital for doctors to examine and test to see what the problem might be

Females dont ejaculate Females have an orgasm Your partner is probably not doing it right Your partner needs to locate your clitoris and Gspot to help you have an orgasm 

Also the length of time you spend may also be a factor It takes a longer time for women to achieve an orgasm than men Hence your partner may need to persist until you achieve an orgasm

Am I premature ejaculated 
why do I not get erected when I put on a condom
if am premature ejaculated what should I do to be strong
Thank you",130,565,[en:0.9999975036547523],"Hello Thank you for using Wellvis

1 The average time for males to ejaculate is 2 to 5 minutes However some males have mastered the ability to hold off ejafulation for a while You dont have premature ejafulation 
2 Your erection goes down probably because the condom is too tight Just as there are different penile sizes there are also different condom sizes If you use one that is too tight it may cut off blood supply to your penis and cause it to shrink So get an appropriate sized condom 
3 You can train yourself to last longer before ejaculation by pausing your thrusts when you feel like ejaculating Pause for few seconds until you feel the urge to ejaculated disappear Repeat this until you are ready to orgasm Do this often and you will get used to it

1550,13,Pregnancy,pls help me  Ive been going through series of stress lately and Ive been on meds which includes ibuprofen though i had unprotected sex 2days before my menstruation would start which was supposed to be on the 28th day  but today is the 30th day of my cycle and i havent yet seen my menses Though Ive been having all signs of pms especially that pain in my vagina which seems like my flow is about to come out  Would i say Im pregnant,102,432,[en:0.9999958009172136],"Hi 
first and foremost kindly stop the ibuprofen recurrent misuse of drugs like ibuprofen will have untoward health consequences much later  If you had sex 2 days before the onset of your menstruation then you are unlikely to be pregnant but this is also not exact as there are slim chances of a pregnancy occurring  The best thing for you to do right now is to buy a pregnancy test kit or go to a lab and have a pregnancy test done  The test will let you know if you are pregnant or not  Staying worried wont help you in any way  Thanks",119,537,[en:0.9999971446469642]

Sorry about your experience depending on the extent of the burns i would advise that you keep the area as clean as possible so the burns dont get infected  Try to wear briefs that will ensure you do not sweat too much in the area The burns should heal over the next couple of days if you ensure its clean and not infected  If the burns are large and deep kindly see a doctor physically for assessment and course of management",85,428,[en:0.9999967564292702]

It is normal at times for that thick white discharge you see from your wife to happen it is not a bad thing as it usually results from good sexual stimulation  It is not a sign of infection or a disease it is a normal discharge  The itch in the clitoris might actually just be a tingling sensation from sexual excitement it has nothing to do with the fungal infection as you assumed So rest easy and enjoy intercourse with your wife the white discharge is normal and its a sign that you doing well in your services to her

There is no specific ideal time and if one gets a likely STI from sexual exposure the different organisms that can cause they have varying times when they appear and start to manifest  If one gets infected the infection would most likely manifest and will let one know that something is wrong in most cases but after about 1 week any STI that has been passed on will likely show up on tests  For HIV you will have to wait for at least 36 months also ensuring you have had no unprotected sex within that period to know if one has been infected",110,546,[en:0.9999962369236267]

Based on your complaints and how common this complaints are I believe what your are experiencing is heartburn which is caused by acidic stomach contents coming back up towards the throat acid reflux It is often accompanied by an unpleasant sour taste in the mouth 

Lots of people get heartburn from time to time and sometimes theres no obvious reason why
However it has been shown that certain foods or activities worsen it 
such as coffee alcohol chocolate beans and fatty or spicy foods being overweight smoking pregnancy stress and anxiety etc

Skincare products are required to be very specific cause of the sensitivity of different peoples skin and skin type I advice that you speak to a dermatologist or a beautician for a private session

That being said there are some systemic conditions that might cause acnes and hyperpigmentation therefore I highly recommend a dermatologist to rule out other conditions

This is just an advice 
1 Try reducing weight if you are overweight or obesebecause the female breast is made up of specialized tissues that produces milk glandular tissue as well as fatty tissue The amount of fat determines the size of the breast So if you dont want a big burst reduction of weight through diet and exercise can help
2 If you are on hormonal pills that contain oestrogen  it will affect the size of your breast because oestrogen hormone influences the breast development causing fat to be deposited in the breast So l will advice you to avoid oestrogen containing contraceptives

1621,13,Pregnancy,Anyone experienced cord around fetal neck during pregnancywhats the best thing to do,15,84,[en:0.999998061636225],"Hello there and thanks for using Wellvis

It is not uncommon to see babies with their umbilical cord wrapped around their necks It is not as a result of any cause from the mother and usually does not cause any harm during delivery It is sometimes but not always associated with excess amniotic fluid or when there is more than one baby in the womb It is usually loosely wrapped around the neck allowing normal foetal blood flow 

If detected early it is not a cause for concern as long as the baby movements can still be felt throughout the pregnancy During labour the heart rate and vitals of the baby will be monitored as usual to detect any distress and act accordingly If it is a normal delivery with the head coming out first one of things always checked for is if the cord is around the neck This will be removed first before delivering the rest of the babys body

So its important to regular at and report any changes during antenatal visits as well as making sure delivery occurs in a health facility from skilled hands

Feel free to ask more questions to any of our doctors using the chat function below related to this or any other health issues We can also assist with referrals if you need to start antenatal

1629,1,General Health,Pls how can I stop running stomach,8,34,[en:0.9999973505314407],"Hi Chima and thanks for using Wellvis

I am assuming by running stomach you mean diarrhoea as my reply will be under this assumption

The treatment of diarrhoea depends on the age of the person affected the nature of the stool being passed the possible cause and other factors In majority of cases the diarrhoea resolves on its own within a few days without any intervention or treatment

The main aim of treatment is to replenish the electrolytes and fluids being lost by taking water rehydration solutions soup but be wary of fruit juice as they can worsen diarrhoea In severe cases it may require an IV drip at a health facility

If the cause is infectious bacteria or parasites antibiotics can be taken to treat any infections Signs like blood in stool are pointers towards a possible infection However note that some antibiotics may in fact cause or worsen diarrhoea so ensure you only take an antibiotic prescribed by a doctor

Other underlying conditions need to be treated Consult with your doctor if you are having recurrent episodes of diarrhoea

Avoiding possible triggers or causes like dairy spicy foods sugary foods foods high in fats and fibre etc can help prevent onset or worsening of the diarrhoea

Only take antidiarrhoeal medications when prescribed by you are sure the cause of diarrhoea is not infectious These medications should not be given to children

You can also chat with one of our doctors using the chat function below and a more tailored answer as well as recommendations will be given to you

Fallopian tubes connect the ovaries and the uterus and every month during ovulation the egg travels from the ovaries to the uterus via the tubes Therefore once these tubes are blocked the chances of pregnancy are slimmer 

The most common cause of blocked fallopian tubes is PID others include 	previous ectopic pregnancy endometriosis etc Also tubes can be blocked due to tubal ligation a procedure whereby tubes are medically tied 

Blocked tubes are usually diagnosed with a specialized xray called a hysterosalpingogram HSG 

Treatment options vary and are dependent on the degree of blockage or if both tubes are affected Options include surgery IVF or reversal of ligation depending on the results of examinations",153,727,[en:0.9999973979257648]

After it stopped two days after which was yesterday I started noticing spotting and the blood does not resemble a menstrual blood and today again the bleeding continues in the form of very little spotting I dont know what is happening maybe its the postinor causing the spotting and why did my period stopped on the third day instead of my normal five days cycle and after two days now why Im I noticing little blood spotting",130,666,[en:0.9999989906697421],"Hi the postinor you took can have an effect on your period and this is not an unusual occurrence in a lot of cases your period might and should revert to the usual duration at the next cycle The spotting could just be a oneoff occurrence that you dont have to worry about has it stopped if it has then i would advise you not to worry if it continues it will be good for you to see a doctor for examination but overall there is nothing for you to worry about so far

Apologies for the tardy response and I hope it still benefits you

Sorry about the symptoms you are experiencing Keloids can be very discomforting especially when they are itchy and painful in some cases This itching is common with keloids and though much is not understood about them the itching may be associated to its interactions with nerves within the skin To remedy this I will recommend visiting a dermatologist who will advice on any of the available treatments like steroids surgical removal or others However unfortunately keloids seem to resurface after intervention

Regarding your second question I am unsure if you are referring to the affected breast or the keloid But please know that keloids do not affect the normal function of the breast to the best of my knowledge Except maybe its impeding suckling in breastfeeding mothers if the keloid is around the nipple

Im a first time mother and my baby is a year  Although i had my baby through cs and i actually took precautions after that But recently when i lay down on my left side to be precise i feel pain in my abdomen like theres an open wound internally or something Please what should i do",63,301,[en:0.9999981865270261],"Hi
Congratulations on your new baby It is a good idea for you to go back for assessment after a few days of discharge for the doctor to examine the site of the CS and be sure of  how the wound is doing Also depending on how long ago was the CS its normal for you to have some form of pain while the wound is healing this pain should go away after a while but if it doesnt go away or get worse please go and see the doctor who did the operation
