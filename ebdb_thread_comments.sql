But if you find yourself panicking frequently for no apparent reason, then you might be suffering from a panic disorder. 

Panic attacks are sometimes triggered by certain memories or events in your life. Other times, they can happen spontaneously without any trigger. So to understand the cause, you need to try and remember if you had any specific thoughts or experienced certain things before your previous panic episodes occurred. 

As for treatment, firstly, you need to understand that panic attacks are not life threatening (meaning that you are not likely to die or be physically harmed from having a panic attack). So relax. 

The next time you have a panic attack, do the following: 

1. Stay where you are 
2. Breathe in and out, deeply and slowly
3. Remind yourself that it is just another panic attack and it will be over in a few minutes. 

Panic attacks usually resolve on their own within 5 - 20 minutes. 

However, if your panic attacks are so frequent that they prevent you from having a normal day at work or at home, then you need to visit a psychologist. The psychologist may ask you to perform some exercises on a regualr basis and may also prescribe some medications to help.

The tenderness of your breasts could be due to a couple of reasons, if you are lactating, engorgement with milk can cause it to be tender, also if there is an inflammation of the breast, it could be tender too. Is the breast warm in comparison to the other one, are there cracks or wounds on it? Have you ever felt a lump in it? 
Taking an analgesic like Diclofenac (with food) will help relieve the pain, but if you notice any of the things i mentioned above, go see a doctor for a more detailed evaluation, this will help ascertain the cause and will be helpful in knowing the definitive steps to take to ensure its managed. 
Thanks.

It sounds as if you may have a sensitivity or allergy to these things you mentioned. It would be good to know how long you''ve had this problem, and exactly what else happens when you are exposed? - itchy eyes, runny nose, rash, breathing difficulty etc.
 If this is the case, then  an examination by your GP to check there are no other problems will be a good idea; and if so, they may start you on a regular antihistamine to control the symptoms, especially if you cannot totally avoid them. 
In addition, check if there is a family history of allergy  - asthma, eczema, hay fever, etc which could also help identify the nature of your symptoms. Thanks!', 70, 74, 0, null, 0, '2018-10-14 15:31:30', '2019-07-07 16:56:30', null);

3. If you are worried about the size or have any symptoms from it, you can have it removed to give you rest if mind, but asides that you don''t have to worry or stress yourself about it.

If so, it might be a worth while venture to openly and freely discuss with your spouse about this issue. Communication break down between partners has been found to be a major player in unsatisfactory sexual intercourse among partners.

Also, rather than the penetrative intercourse itself, you might want to consider spending a lot more time on foreplay (if you have not tried this before). Foreplay helps because it directs attention away from you to how better you can please your partner. Do kindly ask her in what ways she would like you to please her.

You might also want to consider seeing a specialist about this issue.

According to Sigmund Freud, there are different stages of sexual development which a human passes through.  
The first stage is said to be the oral stage and is seen in the first year of life where the child derives pleasure from inserting objects into their mouth. 
This perhaps explains the issue with your daughter. It is expected. 

I would advise that you take several preventive measures into ensuring that objects that can cause harm are placed out of her reach. Extreme care should be taken of particularly small objects which may be swallowed and cause medical emergency. 

If you have noticed any other associated problem, I would advise seeking the help of a specialist for a full evaluation.

I believe the real danger is not in the actual act of spreading the underwear (provided the underwear is well clipped to prevent it from dropping to the floor) in the bathroom. The danger, however minimal, might lie in not letting the underwear properly dry before use.

There might be some degree of discomfort in the use of damp underwear.

Good morning. 

There could be a lot of reasons why you have not seen your period. 

Firstly, you may be pregnant if you are sexually active so you might want to do a pregnancy test. 

Stress is also known to be a cause of delayed periods so you may want to check if you are under any form of stress and adjust. 

It could be a hormonal. Too much fat or too little fat can cause absent menses. 

It can be an infection going on.

If you have had unprotected sexual intercourse in the past few months, you might want to consider visiting a hospital to run tests. 

Please note that these tests are important in order to avoid treating the symptoms you have described blindly. Different organisms can cause the same set of symptoms and the treatment must be specific in order to be quick and less burdensome for you.

Sometimes women experience fluctuations in their menstrual flow and it also varies from one woman to another. Most doctors will tell you the regular flow lasts 3-7 days.

Truly sorry to hear about your complaint.
It''s important to note that as far as something being wrong with you is concerned, the peculiarities of your living arrangement with your partner poses a problem in stating that definitively.

Infertility is considered as the inability to become pregnant after regular (well spread 2-3 times, weekly) unprotected sexual intercourse. Importantly, this must have gone on over a duration of a year.

Unfortunately, the living schedule with your partner makes that continuous over a year intercourse rather impossible.

This might be hard but you and your partner will have to find a living arrangement that lets you spend a much more extended period of time together than that 1 month span.

Sorry to hear about your complaint.

As you have rightly pointed out, masturbation can indeed affect your sexual performance through premature ejaculation.

The best advice I can offer you is largely bahvioural, which while may take some time to fully yield fruit, has been shown to not only improve sexual performance but also your overall relationship with your partner.

To start with, keep in mind that sex must be enjoyed by both partners. Penetrative intercourse tends to place more emphasis on your own pleasure so you must learn to prioritise foreplay. Find out how your partner likes to be touched and in what new ways you can please her without penetrative sex.

Even when you do have penetrative sex and you feel the urge to ejaculate, reduce the intensity of your thrusts and relax. This will require communication with your partner.

Also, the use of condoms can help as it reduces penile sensitivity. There are also medications available in pharmacies.

Masturbation is a normal part of sexual health, it has its benefits too. 

However, if it prevents you from going about your routine activities or affects your daily life negatively, and you can no longer control the urge to masturbate, then you will need or attempt to quit.

I’m no sex therapist, but like any other habit that you might want to quit, you must overcome urges and behaviors you’ve practiced for a while and this can take some time but I believe you should be able to achieve what you want. 

Some steps and strategies to help include
1. Be honest with yourself
2. Get and stay busy to reduce the chances to masturbate

It is wonderful that you have taken the bold step to stop.
Apart from seeing a behavioral therapist, you need to identify the triggers and avoid them (it could be friends or even stress).

Vaginitis is a term used to describe vaginal inflammation or infection, characterised by itching, foul-smelling discharge and sometimes, pain. Number of factors have been known to cause this, and these include imbalance in vaginal normal flora, bacterial infection and oestrogen depletion in post menopausal women.
The vagina has its own resident microorganisms (normal flora) which perform protective roles in the vagina. Once these organisms are depleted due to some unhealthy practices like douching (washing inside of the vagina with soap), usage of vaginal spray, etc...other harmful bacteria can then begin to multiply in the vagina, leading to infection.
These bacteria can also invade the vagina in cases relating to immunosuppression.
It is advisable that any female with symptoms of vaginitis visit a doctor, who can further examine and run some tests to know the exact organisms implicated, and as such prescribe the appropriate medication to CURE the condition.

I''m sorry about the stress you''ve had so far, with contraceptives.
Hormonal contraceptives can cause weight gain and progesterone-only implants are notorious for causing menstrual irregularities.
If you use combined oral contraceptives, your menstrual cycle will be regular but you may still gain weight. Also note that you have to take the pills everyday at a regular time.
You could also use a non-hormonal intrauterine contraceptive device like Copper IUCD, which won''t make you gain weight or cause menstrual irregularities, but it may cause heavy menstrual flow.
There are barrier methods that you could use too, in form of female condom or cervical cap. You could also use spermicidal creams.
Kindly visit the family planning clinic for any of these options that will be suitable for you.

Viruses are the most common cause but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause it. It can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver cancer. Many more people don’t even know that they have hepatitis.

There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E.

A and E are typically caused by consumption of contaminated food or water. 

B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer.
B, C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids. Common ways of catching these viruses include receipt of contaminated blood or blood products, invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment and for hepatitis B transmission from mother to baby at birth, from family members/domestic help to child, and also by sexual contact.

Acute infection may occur with limited or no symptoms, or may include symptoms such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.

Treatment options are determined by which type of hepatitis you have and whether the infection is acute or chronic.

WAYS TO PREVENT HEPATITIS;
1. Practicing good hygiene especially with how you prepare what you eat and drink or get them from. 

2. Hepatitis B, C, and D contracted through contaminated blood can be prevented by: not sharing needles, razors, someone else’s toothbrush, not touching spilled blood. 
Hepatitis B and C can also be contracted through sexual intercourse and intimate sexual contact. Practicing safe sex by using condoms and dental dams can help decrease the risk of infection.

Jaundice. (Your skin or the whites of the eyes turn yellow, and your pee turns brown or orange.)
Light-colored poop
Fever
Fatigue that persists for weeks or months

I do not completely understand your question. However, I will use this opportunity to talk about STIs and I hope I address your concern. 

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that can be caught or passed on when you have UNPROTECTED sex, or close sexual contact, with another person who already has an STI.
Using a condom during sex is the best way to avoid STIs including HIV, if you cannot abstain. 
Also reducing the number of sexual partners also means you’re less likely to get infected.

If you suspect you have an STIs please go and see a doctor because symptoms vary from person to person and if you have been diagnosed with an STI, let your sexual partners know and encourage them to get tested and treated too. 

There are many different STIs and there are many signs and symptoms that mean you may have gotten one, but sometimes, there are no signs at all. When STIs do produce symptoms, they usually develop around the penis or vagina. Your sexual partners may also experience symptoms.

Generally, the symptoms of STIs can include: 
* unusual and/or smelly discharge from the penis, vagina or anus
* pain during urination
* sores, blisters, ulcers, warts or rashes in the genital area
* pain in the scrotum or testicles
* lumps and bumps on the genitals.

You can visit a General Hospital around you for check up and treatment.', 13, 309, 0, null, 0, '2019-07-28 11:53:57', '2019-07-28 11:53:57', null);

I’m glad you already know that nutrition as well as lifting weights play significant and complimentary roles in bulking and gaining muscle mass. 
However, I would also like to remind you that it is a lifestyle as it involves both the time you spend in and outside the gym.
You will benefit from exercising regularly and eating well-planned diets. 

The whole process of bulking up (increasing muscle mass) and cutting (reducing body fat) is a detailed one and requires real commitment. 

We are yet to sign up fitness experts on the platform but we hope to eventually get a few in the coming weeks, so keep checking for comments. 

In the meantime, I can tell you some groups of food to pay eat more of and those to avoid to help increase your muscle mass and eventual strength at the gym. 

Foods to eat more of; 
Beans, rice, moinmoin, swallows such as eba, amala and co. are usually good during the bulking season. Oatmeal makes really great breakfast. 
Bread, cereal, crackers, popcorn, fruits (oranges, apples, bananas, grapes, pears, watermelon) Potatoes, yams, corn, green peas. Vegetables and nuts too. 

You should limit alcohol and processed sugars or deep fried foods. 

You might also consider supplements such as whey protein, creatine and caffeine (which decreases fatigue and allows you to work harder) 

Speak to your trainer and the gym and do some research too. There are a lot of Instagram accounts that document their journeys and provide answers to questions like these, you should check them out too. 

Good luck with the bulking!', 13, 320, 0, null, 0, '2019-07-31 17:52:36', '2019-07-31 17:52:36', null);

The chances of you getting pregnant if you have sex 3 days after your period are low, but it is very possible, especially if for example you ovulate early, also note that the sperm can survive for up to 5 days after being released into the body.

I believe 30 mins falls within the average duration of the refractory period. This is the period after ejaculation in which the penis becomes soft/flaccid again and goes through a “rest”. During the refractory period, a man most times cannot get aroused as his body does not respond to sexual stimulation and he is unable to get an erection within this period. I personally do not see the reason for worry considering this is a normal occurrence.

-Avoid skipping breakfast, so that you don''t have to eat junks during the day.

Sounds like a case of easy exhaustion , which can be due to a number of things, such as anaemia, mental health disorders and chronic fatigue syndrome (which can only be diagnosed after all the other causes have been ruled out)

What about short term memory? Are there associated body pains or tenderness? Where you ill before you started feeling constantly fatigued? 

Finding the underlying cause will require ruling out a number of causes until the reason is identified or ruled out and this means a number of tests. However, the doctor has to rule out anaemia, check out your thyroid, liver and kidney functions etc. 

Following the results of those tests, the doctor will be able to know the line of action to take.
Meanwhile, try to reduce physical and emotional stress, you can start yoga if possible and gradual exercise programs with a physiotherapist (will also help with the back pain)

5. Drink plenty of water, up to 3/4 L spread across the day. 

6. Eat high-fibre foods such as fruit and veg, oats, wholegrain bread, and beans.

7. Don''t start unsustainable diets 

8. Healthy snacks, for when you have to much such as fruit, oat cakes, unsalted or unsweetened popcorn, and dried fruits.

9. Cut down on alcohol and processed sugars, sodas and carbonated drinks

Washing your face regularly, about twice per day, especially when it gets sweaty. This helps to keep oil from building up and clogging your pores. Don''t over-wash or use harsh scrubs. Acne is not caused by dirt. Two gentle washings a day is enough. Too much cleaning can leave skin irritated and dry, triggering glands to produce more oil, increasing the likelihood of pimples.

Stress or hormonal changes can also worsen pimples outbreak. 

Cosmetics and makeup that have a greasy consistency may also clog pores. Water-based products are less likely to cause pimples than oil-based makeup. Use oil-free or noncomedogenic products (those that won''t clog pores) on your face.

Without the knowledge of your wife’s medical and obstetrics history, it is hard to say why an operation - cesarean section, has been advised. However, when it is advised by your doctor, a CS is usually a safer option for the mother and the baby than a vaginal delivery. My advise is that you speak to the doctor, who can allay your fears by explaining the exact reasons for a CS. 

Some indications for a planned CS include (but are not limited to) the following; 
1. When your baby/babies are in an abnormal position, or if the mother carrying more than one baby, a CS is often the safest way to deliver them without dangerous complications. 
2. If there''s a problem with the mother’s placenta. If the placenta is covering all or part of the opening of the mother’s cervix, a CS is highly recommended for delivery.
3. In cases of prolapsed umbilical cord, that is when a part of umbilical cord slips through your cervix before of your baby, is another indication for a CS. 
4. If the physical health of the mother is a concern, conditions such as a heart or brain disorders might make the doctor request a CS.
5. If there’s a mechanical obstruction obstructing the birth canal or if your baby has a really large size or head. 
6. A previous CS, although not absolute, is also an indication for a CS.  

As you can see there are multiple reasons for a CS (this is not all), and a doctor has to ensure that all of these do not lead to dangerous outcomes for your wife or child during delivery. 

Please note that any attempt to forcefully go against such advice of a doctor is dangerous and can lead to unfavourable outcomes such as rupture of the womb leading to its complete removal, or death. 

If still uncomfortable with the doctor’s request, you can seek another opinion with a specialist obstetrician.

1. Practice safe sex. Use condoms every time you have sex, limit your number of partners, and always ask about a potential partner''s sexual history.
2. Get regularly tested for STIs. If you''re at risk of an STI, such as chlamydia, make an appointment with your doctor for testing. Set up a regular screening schedule with your doctor if needed. Early treatment of an STI gives you the best chance of avoiding PID.
3. Request that your partner be tested. If you have pelvic inflammatory disease or an STI, advise your partner to be tested and, if necessary, treated. This can prevent the spread of STIs and possible recurrence of PID.
4. Don''t douche. Douching upsets the balance of protective bacteria in your vagina.
5. Temporary abstinence. Avoid sexual intercourse until treatment is completed and tests indicate that the infection has cleared in all partner(s).

2. Keeping the immune system strong by getting enough rest, eating a well-balanced diet and getting regular exercise can also decrease a person''s chances of developing an infection.

Good evening. Sorry about your experience. 

Having sex for the first time is actually painful for the female.   This is usually due to the hymen which is broken and may bleed during intercourse. It usually gets better with time and the pain is less. 

Another cause of painful intercourse is when the lady is not well lubricated, hence the need for adequate foreplay and arousal before penetration. 

again you might want to get rid of any negative thoughts you have about sex becaue if you keep having them, it will always be painful most of the time.

Thanks for your question. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), you must understand does not have any characteristic symptoms that define it. The virus essentially weakens the body''s immune system causing a variety of manifestations which are also commonly seen in different other conditions. Even after an initial period of symptoms such as fever, sore throat, muscle pain; an infected person may show no other symptoms. This does not mean that the person is now better. The virus is simply quietly further taking over the body. Eventually, HIV if untreated, will become AIDS which has even more severe rather non-specific symptoms.

As the old saying goes, "AIDS no dey show for face". Proper treatment with existing HIV medication will prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS and will enable an individual live a practically normal life.

If you suspect that you may have been exposed to the virus at some, kindly do not hesitate to get tested. HIV is not a death sentence!!

Typically, those with ulcer will have the following which may occur singly or together:

dull pain in the stomach.
weight loss ( some types) 
not wanting to eat because of pain and this leads to weight loss. 
nausea or vomiting.
bloating.
feeling easily full.
burping or acid reflux.
heartburn, which is a burning sensation in the chest)

some have abdominal pains which are usually at night or in the early morning hours which sometimes radiates to the back. 

It is often a medical diagnosis as it would require some form of testing before treatment.

I hope this helps.

You sound like you are constipated. Without any underlying serious diseases, some common causes include dehydration, lack of dietary fibre, physical inactivity or medication side effects.

To help relieve this, I will advise the following;

- Try warm liquids, especially in the morning.
- Add fruits and vegetables to your diet, especially oranges to help relieve the constipation.
- Exercise most days of the week. When you move your body, the muscles in your intestines are usually more active, too.

are you getting enough sleep?

Are you stressed out?

Headaches, fever and running stomach are a rather vague set of symptoms become of how common they occur. Are there other associated symptoms? Does the cluster characteristics of the headache occur with fever and running stomach at the same time? Is there abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting? 
Depending on the answers, you might have food poisoning, an underlying infection, or migraines.

It often awakens you in the middle of the night with intense pain in or around one eye/ one side of your head and the pain most times ends as suddenly as it started. Usually leaving you exhausted after the headache. 
They are referred to as “cluster headache” because there are bouts of attacks that occur with a period, this is know as a cluster period.  It can lasts for up to months and then followed by remission periods when there are no attacks. 

If you suffer cluster headaches you may experience the following; a sudden onset that lasts for between 15 minutes to three hours, often occurs at the same time each day and mostly at night. Described as an excruciating pain that is generally situated around ONE eye, but may radiate to other areas of your face, head and neck, one-sided pain with excessive tearing and associated restlessness. 
Some people complain of sensitivity to light and sound.

It is true that some viral or fungal infections of the skin can cause generalised itching with or without rashes after a shower.

By weak erections I suppose you mean inability to sustain an erection.

The reasons vary and could be due to some factors like age, body size or body mass index (BMI), disease, lifestyle, mental state to name a few

The “strength” of erections normally decreases after 50 years (some say later than this). However in younger men, this could happen once in a while and should not be a concern except when it’s becoming too frequent. If the frequency is increased regardless of age, you should see a doctor to do a proper assessment of what could be the possible cause.

Your body size may also influence your erection. Being overweight or obese puts you at risk of erectile dysfunction. Obesity also hampers your enjoyment of the intercourse process which could affect your esteem and mental state. So it’s important to embark on a weight loss program and exercise often. Obesity also puts you at risk of diseases like diabetes and hypertension which can affect your erection.

Diseases too like the ones mentioned above, diabetes and hypertension, and others like prostate disorders could lead to erectile dysfunction. A history of trauma to the penis or scrotum, deformities in the penis etc are also possible factors. Again, a full assessment by your doctor could identify this.

Are you in a sound state of mind? Are you depressed? Are you anxious and over worrying? Especially with young men, this could influence your erections. Having a relaxed and worry free mind can improve this condition.

If this tends to occur during intercourse, are you indulging in foreplay with your partner? Taking it slow allows for the urge to heighten and the blood flow to the penis to increase. Enjoy the process of intercourse and don’t rush it. Talk with your partner if there are any insecurities. This can boost the attraction between you two and make the process enjoyable.

Exercise always as this boosts the production of sexual hormones.

Sorry to hear about your eye trouble.

Itchy eyes could be possibly due to dry eyes, allergies or perhaps an infection. The infection might most likely be associated with a discharge so if your eyes have no discharge, then it just might not be an infection.

However, short term measures you can take include immersing a piece of clean cloth (perhaps a new napkin) and soaking in cold water. Close your eyes and place the  cold napkin over your eyes. It should help with the itching.

Besides that, you could also visit a trusted pharmacy and request for an eye drop that could help with your itching.

If this itching becomes persistent, please kindly visit an ophthalmologist i.e. an eye doctor.

However, considering you have had your period again, then I believe we can just write this off as a late period. 
A healthy menstrual cycle can range from every 21 to 35 days.

Having one or two irregular cycles a year is nothing abnormal. It can be caused by hormonal imbalance and high stress usually seen during an illness, travel, emotional stress etc., as this throws your cycle off.

However, let’s assume you took the right pill and of good quality, the best way to confirm loss of pregnancy after an abortive attempt is to do a repeat pregnancy test in 4 weeks, only then can you confirm a pregnancy loss.

Without treatment, STIs can spread to the reproductive organs, resulting in Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), and if left untreated, PID can result in chronic pelvic pain and infertility.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder falls under a category of mental illnesses called neurotic disorders.

Like other mental health conditions, there are a set of criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of OCD can be made. Please note that OCD, unlike its potrayal in social media, does not refer to someone who takes hygeine seriously. It is a highly distressing condition with serious life implications for an affected person. 

Due to this, anyone seeking to determine if they actually have this condition must visit a specialist psychiatrist who will be in a better position to make this diagnosis and offer a solution that will range from behavioural modification to drug therapy.

Growth of molars is usually age dependent and are usually the last teeth as you may know. The growth tends to be slower than your other type of teeth. 

Pain usually comes because it''s pushing through the overlying gum till it reaches its final position. This can be very discomforting especially when chewing. I will recommend consuming softer foods so you do not have to exert a lot of force while chewing. 

Pain killers can be taken to relieve any pain. 

Mouth hygiene is important too. You may want to use antiseptic/antibacterial mouthwash and avoid the toothbrush on that area as it grows. 

But if the pain is unbearable, you''re bleeding from that area, you develop a foul odour in your mouth, kindly visit your local dentist for a specialist checkup.

In a lot of cases they are unexplainable and the weakness goes off after a few days. So my advice? give it a few days, ensure you have enough sleep (about 8 hours), then lets see what happens, if you see no improvement, see a doctor.

NB: Don''t let anyone deceive you that it is because you are short of blood and you need blood tonic, they will only be wasting your money.

Sorry to hear about your distress

It''s important to know that disruptions to the menstrual cycle may be caused by a number of reasons besides pregnancy. Often overlooked factors such as changes in diet and stress may be responsible for delayed cycles.

However, because the menstrual cycle is regulated by a number of chemicals called hormones within the body system; it is too much of a reach to attempt to pin point a cause without proper laboratory testing.

Therefore, please kindly visit a Specialist Gynaecologist who will examine you and then ask you to do some tests following which an appropriate course of treatment may then be determined.

Please do not worry. Kindly follow the above.

I suppose you''re referring to the mild bleeding that occurs when the fertilised ovum implants on the uterus following a few days after sexual intercourse.

While some facts may be difficult to recall, there are some subtle hints that can be a pointer to what kind of bleeding it was. Among these are the colour and volume of the blood. You are most likely aware of the color of your period blood by now. Implantation bleeding is usually of a lighter shade of red, usually mostly spotting and barely continuous for as long as period bleeding. Another important factor is whether or not this bleeding happened around the time you are supposed to menstruate. If it did, it might not be implantation bleeding.

More importantly however, please purchase a pregnancy test kit at a pharmacy near you to be sure.

I would also advise the use of protection in the future particularly to avoid the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases.

Good afternoon. 

Your worry is genuine but I want to reassure you that you are fine. typically , we start worrying when its after 12 months and there has been regular unprotected sexual intercourse between couples. 

However, there are some conditions that you need to meet to take in. 

You need to have regular sexual intercourse at least three times a week, you need to have an idea of when you are ovulating to maximize the chances of getting pregnant. 

Typically signs of ovulation include having breat tenderness and nipples get a bit sensitive, ovulation pain, increase in basal body temperature. you can make use of the regular ovulation prediction kits. 

After intercourse, do not be quick to get up from the bed as to allow the sperms find their way up the genital tract. 

you may want to also take preconceptional folic acid daily. do more fruits alongside your husband.

Seizures can be caused by many things ranging from infections, issues in your cardiovascular system and even your metabolism to name a few. To be able to know the cause your doctor will be interested in some information like your mum''s age, onset of the seizures (8 years in her case), duration of seizures (how long does an episode last?), what kind of seizures (one part of her body or the whole body shaking), does anything happen before, during or after the seizure; any family history of seizures, is she on any medication, does she consume alcohol, does it interfere with her life (which does in most cases), are there any other symptoms? These are just a few of the many details needed to narrow down to a possible cause.

If she has never had it up till only 8 years ago, studies suggest that adults who develop seizures for the first time in adulthood may have a stroke and in some cases, the cause is unknown. 

She may benefit from long term anticonvulsants. But these are not to be self-prescribed or self-administered. I will recommend seeking the consult of a neurologist (a doctor specialized in the human nervous system). You may be asked to repeat the brain scans since it has been over 5 years now and there is a possibility for any issues which were hidden before in the brain to be seen now. This could be because, it may have become more visible to the imaging device or maybe there has been an upgrade of the machine or possibly better expertise in viewing the scan.

In the interim, continue the good job of paying attention to her while together and continue giving her support. Please remember not to put anything in her mouth while she is seizing and limit/eliminate alcohol intake if any. Taking a video while she has an episode to show your doctor may also be of benefit in making a diagnosis.

Itching of the eye could be an indication of allergy, irritation, infection etc.
• It could be associated with redness of the affected eye, excessive tearing and discharge of pus in the case of infections
• Though it is common practice to self medicate, it is not advisable to. Visiting a clinic could help distinguish what is the possible cause. Why, you may ask. Sometimes all you may need is just an antihistamine for an allergy and yet you may be using an antibiotic (like the case of allergic conjuctivits and bacterial conjunctivitis)
• Provided there is clarity on the cause of the itching, the drug may not be right for you. Especially in the case of an infectious cause, the organism responsible may not be sensitive to the eye drops you are using.
• On the issue of drugs, some people do not know their sensitivities to different drugs. As such you are just adding more fuel to the flame.
• For the case of those whose itching may be an allergy, it is advisable to avoid what causes the allergy.
• Do not scratch the eye as this worsens the itching sensation.

My recommendation will be to have your eyes checked at an eye clinic if that has not been done yet before considering what to use next. Washing the eyes with clean water may be of benefit and wear sunglasses if the light is also an issue as well as to serve as a barrier for any irritants in the environment (like smoke and dust).

A number of women of reproductive age will experience their menstrual cycles in several different ways. This includes variations in duration of the accompanying pain.

With regard to your question, a few things need clarification such as if this is the length of time you normally have the cramps for. If it is, you should have no cause for worries. Also, if it is not the regular pattern, has the pain increased in severity and have you noticed any other changes to your menstrual flow within this time period?

External hemorrhoids are much more common with symptoms such as irritation and pain, itchy or burning sensation around the anus, difficulty sitting down, painful bowel movements, blood appearing on toilet tissue after wiping. 

Managing haemorrhoids often requires significant lifestyle changes, this helps to reduce the severity of the symptoms. These include:

1. Drinking plenty of liquids and eating fiber-rich diet keeps stool soft and easy to pass, thus reducing irritation to the haemorrhoids during bowel movements. Fruits, veggies, beans, cereal etc. are useful allies. 
2. Avoid straining and pushing, this worsens and exacerbates haemorrhoids. Do not use harsh toilet paper, preferably use water or wet wipes specific for haemorrhoids. Try to get into a routine where you go at the same time every day.
3. Consider painkillers like Ibuprofen to help with soreness. Aspirin should be avoided as it can thin the blood and make bleeding worse.
4. Take warm baths or sit in a bathtub filled with warm water for about 15 minutes especially after bowel movement. Do not scrub or wash with irritating soaps.
5. Topical creams for haemorrhoids with witch hazel can soothe pain, however be careful of creams with hydrocortisone due to the side effect of prolonged use (not more that 1 week is advised) 
6. Ice packs can dull pain and bring down the swelling. 
7. Wear loose, soft underwear to keep the area aired out and stops moisture from building up to prevent irritation

Sorry about your experience.

1. Try to eat a lot of vegetables, foods & fruits with high fibre content e.g Apple, wheat etc. They aid digestion, and will make your stooling much easier.
2. Don''t force your stools out when you go to defecate. Drinking water (lots) hours before you go to the toilet will help to soften the stools.
3. There are suppositories that will help ease the pain and aid the healing. 
4. Avoid high fat foods and junks, they digest slowly and will make your stools difficult to expel.
5. Don''t keep stools in for too long, the longer they get, the harder they become.


If you follow all these, you should be able to live more freely without heamorrhoids.

Well,there is growing  controversy amongst dental practitioners as regards,whether a heavily pregnant woman should be allowed to undergo tooth extraction or not.Some  dental experts have advocated for the removal of the source of pain (arguing that if the source of pain is not eliminated,the natural chemical substances released by the body in response to such pain can induce labour).However,another group of dental  experts says,it is better you delay the extraction(removal of tooth)  till after delivery as long as there is no obvious spreading infection.
Personally,I would recommend that you follow what your dentist says (in line with the second school of thought) by delaying the extraction till delivery(which can happen be any moment  from now)-This is because the process of trying to remove the tooth might be stressful for a heavily pregnant woman.Besides the dental chair poisoning is somewhat uncomfortable for heavily pregnant women(with the possibilty of the fetus compressing on the venae cavae and possibly bringing about dizziness or  fainting spells to the mother while on the dental chair).

However,since you said there is an obvious hole on the said tooth, i''d recommend that you avoid chewing using  with that side till when you are ready to remove the tooth.This is because,chewing on the tooth will provoke pain as long as food enters into the hole.

Heaviness of the breast could be as a result of hormonal changes. Except if it is a new occurrence and it is not associated with your period, then, there might be a need to clear your doubts.

Nausea and pain in the upper part of your abdomen are not specific symptoms as they could be seen in many illnesses.

Pregnancy symptoms takes many form in different people. While some are throwing up copiously, others are being weak.

Now that you are pregnant, you may have to slow down on some things and listen a little bit to your body that is trying to tell you something. I am not saying you have to go lazy or idle; instead, you have to expect a little reduction in the way you do things compared to how you were able to do in the past.

You have to eat very well, healthy and nutrition meals, appropriate and healthy snacks (fresh fruits), and of course lots and lots of water. 

Use your daily drugs. They will help you a lot, probably more than you think. Rest, exercise lightly and go for your regular antenatal check ups.

Trimethylaminuria is a metabolic disorder cause by the inability of the body to break down trimethylamine. 
Trimethylamine has a fishy odor and is produced in the intestines when certain types of food (i.e. eggs, liver, legumes, fish and some vegetables) are digested. When it can’t be broken down, this leads to an accumulation in the body causing it to be excreted via the sweat, urine, and breath, giving them  a characteristic fishy odor of trimethylaminuria.

An attempt at diagnosis usually starts with the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms, followed by urine test (to check the amount of trimethylamine in the urine) and genetic testing which are used to confirm the diagnosis.

Unfortunately, there’s no growing baby.

The hormone that signals pregnancy is still usually being released, and this can be read during pregnancy as a viable pregnancy, however, an obstetric scan will reveal the true status of the pregnancy.

While irregularities in menstrual cycle may occur from a number of factors such as stress, exercise or pyschological reasons; it is also important to ask if you have had unprotected sexual intercourse in the last month as this may be a pointer to what may be wrong.

Kindly note that there is a 21-35 day range for a menstrual cycle to be completed and if you are still within this range, there might be little cause for worry. 

Be patient and kindly update us over the course of the next 1-2 weeks.

Penile discharge that’s neither urine nor semen requires medical attention. It is a common symptom of many STDs and can also be caused by other things.

Having severe cramps at night may not be a good sign.

Having a urinary tract infection can cause that for you and if not addressed could lead to a miscarrige. 

It will also be nice to note that you should also take a lot of water as dehydration can also give you this picture. 

I advise you go to a hospital and see a doctor for proper evaluation including tests like urinalysis and others to ascertain that there is no infection going on.

You can also use the opportunity to request for a pap smear  which checks for cervical changes that may be indictaive of cervical cancer/neoplasia.

For all its worth, the pain could be from a nerve compression which could arise from poor sleeping position or some of trauma .

There is also the possibility of having an angina, which actually originates from the heart and indicative of heart disease or the blood vessels around the heart. 

This usually manifests as pain in the left hand that may be followed by chest pain some times. 

Since you are in your forties, i suggest you see a doctor asap. You might also want to consider doing a comprehensive medical examination. 

For the mean time, you can take some analgesics to ease the pain. 

I hope this helps. 

Get well soon.

Sorry to hear about your complaints.

Injuries such as the one that you had usually require patience in the rehabilitation phase. I''m not entirely sure of the extent of the injury or what conversations you may have had with your doctor about the care of your finger post cast removal but I will advice patience.

Don''t rush the process, attempt moving the finger always but not to the same degree as you would have if you had not had that injury. 

As you exercise it more and more, the finger should return to full functionality with time.', 207, 524, 0, null, 0, '2019-09-10 08:42:07', '2019-09-10 08:42:07', null);

Usually when a cast is removed, it is not unusual to experience certains things such as; pain, swelling and in this case stiffness of the joints involved, and sometimes muscle atrophy. This can last a few days to weeks, depending on how long the cast was on for and what you have started doing since removal of the cast. 

As this is normal, it is important that a repeat xray is done to ensure a correct fusion of the bones followed by some medications (if indicated) and most importantly physiotherapy.

Physiotherapy is the best way to improve the strength and flexibility of your fingers and help you return to activity within a few weeks.
A physiotherapist will design a range of techniques that suits your needs and in most cases, will ensure you can do the exercises at home. These exercises are important to ensure you give yourself the best chance of a full recovery.

Good morning. 

Just give it some time and soon you will be able to fold into a fist. The thing is this: that joint had been placed in one position for a long time and it would take some time for you to be able to regain full mobility of the joint. 

I suggest you keep moving and folding it to whatever extent is possible from time to time. it would help with the stiffness.

Good morning. 

The only symptom you described is just sweating. it would be nice if you can let us know if there are any other associated symptoms. 

That being said, it seems to be that you may be suffering from a medical condition called hyperhidrosis which could be primary. 

Another likely possibility is that you probably may have an over active throid ( hyperthyroidism). 

I suggest you see an endocrinologist who will examine you properly and would also need to carry out some investigations including a thyroid function test

Good evening. 

When you say last for hours, what exactly do you mean?

The average time  for penetrative sex is between 3 to 7 minutes, excluding foreplay. when you add foreplay , the time significantly increases. foreplay includes kissing, fondling and smooching before the act itself. 

You dont sound as if you have any form of erectile dysfunction or inability to get your penis up, or inability to have penetrative sex. 

I don''t know what the problem is but you should probably see a doctor or sex therapist for a detailed discussion. 

If you feel that you are not pleasing your partner, it would help to talk things over to know what works best for her rather than looking for perfomance enhancing medications. 

I hope this helps.

There is really no cause for alarm. You can reassure your wife please. Labour will come. 

Typically, some pregnancies may last this long without any sign of labour while some may have put to bed ny now, it is good to note that each pregnancy differs. 

She still has time up to 40 weeks or even 41 weeks. All she needs is close monitoring. she should continue with her antenatal visits. 

Then she should also be watchful about the baby and the movements. If at any point in time, she feesl the baby is not moving as he or she used to, kindly report to your doctor immediately. 

She can walk around more often, and yes, sex can help as the sperm contains substances which can cause uterine contrations. 

That being said, both of you should not be anxious. The labour will come in due time. 

I hope this helps.

We can''t say specifically in this case, but you will need to clarify what you mean by purging. A baby can pass stool as much as they eat in a day.

Sometimes it’s normal to have a “gummy” i.e sticky vaginal discharge somewhere in between clear coloured to whitish. This is the body’s way of keeping the vagina moist and clean and the consistency of the discharge is dependent on what time of the month it is e.g around the time of ovulation, the discharge tends to be clearer and less sticky. 

Do you have other symptoms such as itching or pain while urinating? 

However, it should never have an unpleasant odor, therefore there’s a very high chance that you have an infection. The fishy smell is a telltale of a vaginal infection. 

My advice is that you visit a physician, who will examine you and possibly request some lab investigations before placing you on some medication to treat you. You should also request for a pregnancy test to confirm or allay your fear of pregnancy. 

Ensure that you use protection for sex, use a condom. 

Also, women tend to be more prone to UTIs from sex than men do, therefore; 
- try to urinate before sex, and promptly after,
- wash your genital and anal areas before and after sex and 
- stay hydrated and drink plenty of water.

For many women, pregnancy-related lower back pain starts within the first trimester. In most cases this is expected, due to the fact that as the pregnancy progresses the woman’s posture changes and as the weight of the baby increases in front, it pulls on your back creating a shift in balance and puts a strain on the back.
Also, method of sleeping is often a factor, she should try laying on her side and try to be more comfortable.
Release of some hormones during pregnancy may also cause the ligaments of the lower back to soften as pregnancy progresses. 

Pregnancy-related lower back pain can be relieved or reduced by the following; 
1. By maintaining good posture while seating or standing, also avoid standing for long periods of time.
2. By squatting instead of bending at the waist when she wants to pick something from the floor. Avoid lifting heavy things. 
3. While in bed, try sleeping on the side with pillows tucked beneath your belly and between your knees for gentle support.
4. Practice pregnancy-safe exercises designed to strengthen and support your abdomen and back.
5. When seated, try to elevate your feet and make sure your chair offers good back support. Use a lumbar pillow for additional low back support.
6. Try to get plenty of rest.
7. Discuss these with your physician during your ANC visits.

Vaginal or vulva itching can be caused by irritants, skin disorders, infections, or menopause.

Exposing the vagina to irritants such as feminine sprays, douches, topical creams, ointments etc. can trigger an allergic reaction that creates an itchy rash over various areas of the body, including the vagina.

Some skin diseases, such as eczema and psoriasis, can cause redness and itching in the genital region.

Vaginal yeast infection, a very common condition, alongside some STDs can also cause itching. Yeast infection often occurs after taking a course of antibiotics, which tend to destroy good bacteria needed to keep yeast growth in check.

Although most causes of vaginal itching isn’t too serious a case, you should however contact your doctor if your vaginal itching persists or occurs along with the following symptoms: ulcers or blisters on the vulva, pain or tenderness in the genital area, genital redness or swelling, trouble urinating, an unusual vaginal discharge or discomfort during sexual intercourse.

Sorry about your symptoms. Can I know how old you are? (Menses could be irregular during the first or last years of having a period)

When you say "always have irregularity", how far back do you mean and could you kindly explain in terms of how many days your flow lasts and, after it stops, how long does it take to come back.?  (Months? Years? As mentioned above, age is important but remember if your period returns within 21-35 days, it is normal. And if your bleeding lasts 3-7 days, that is normal too. In some people, the normal is outside these ranges.)

With regards the brownish discharge, when did that start happening? Does it have a bad smell or no smell? Are you sexually active? (These could point towards an infection)
 What kind of bathroom do you use? What material is your underwear made of? Do you douche, that is, clean the inside of your vagina with soap or similar? (Shared bathrooms and unhygienic toilets put women are risk of infections too. Wearing nylon underwear also promotes the growth of bad organisms. Douching is a very harmful practice which kills the beneficial organisms in a woman''s vagina)

Just to add on the extensive information Dr Adeosun has said, when do you expect your next period?

If by that time, you have not seen it, consider doing a pregnancy test. However, note that it is common for the period to be delayed from stress like worrying. So I urge you not to panic and follow Dr Adeosun''s advice.

Remember to use protection if you''re not in a committed relationship and in the event you choose not indulge in barrier contraceptives, there are other methods which are available.

It is possible that you might have had an incomplete miscarriage. 
In situations like this, the scan will show an empty uterus with no signs of pregnancy but the urine/blood tests will still be positive for a few days after. 
Pregnancy tests detect the presence of the pregnancy hormone hCG, however, after a miscarriage occurs, the hormone does not disappear from a woman''s body right away, instead the level of hCG gradually decreases, falling back down to an undetectable level over a period of days, or even weeks, depending on how far along the pregnancy was when the miscarriage happened.

With an incomplete miscarriage, there is still pregnancy tissue leftover in the uterus, but unfortunately, it does not mean that the pregnancy is continuing or is viable. Symptoms are complaints of passage of clots or pieces of tissue plus vaginal bleeding with associated cramps.

A  simple medical procedure might be required to remove the retained products of conception, which is usually only small pieces of the placenta. These tissues will probably be reabsorbed (broken down) by your body in time, but the procedure can help put a stop to heavy bleeding sooner, as bleeding is a common symptom of an incomplete miscarriage.

Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by Candida, which normally lives inside the body (in places such as the mouth, throat, gut, and vagina) and on the skin without causing any problems. However, with prolonged antibiotics use or suppressed immunity, the yeast to grow significantly to cause diseases. 

Candidiasis that develops in the mouth or throat is called “thrush”, while if in the vagina, it is commonly known as a “yeast infection.” Invasive candidiasis can also occur when Candida species enter the bloodstream and affect internal organs. 

In your case, what part of your body is affected? 
Because the question was tagged in the women’s health section, I will go ahead and assume it’s vaginal. 

Women may be more susceptible to vaginal yeast infections if they are pregnant or have diabetes. The use of antibiotics or birth control pills can promote yeast infections. As well as frequent douching.

Vaginal yeast infections may present with the following symptoms; vaginal itch with a classic a thick discharge cottage cheese consistency, a burning discomfort around the vaginal opening, especially if urine touches the area; and pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse. 

Because these symptoms are similar to many other vaginal infections, which are treated with different types of medicines it is in your best interest to speak to a doctor, who can tell you if you have vaginal candidiasis and how to treat it. 

Vaginal yeast infections can be treated with antifungal medications that are applied directly into the vagina as tablets, creams, ointments or suppositories. A single dose of oral fluconazole can be used. For more severe infections, infections that don’t get better, or keep coming back after getting better, other treatments might be needed. 

Wearing cotton underwear might help reduce the chances of getting a yeast infection. Also avoid taking antibiotics that has not been prescribed by your healthcare provider.', 13, 576, 0, null, 0, '2019-09-23 07:06:31', '2019-09-23 07:06:31', null);

Are there other associated symptoms with the pain? How old are you? How long does it last? Does this happen all the time or only some times? etc. These questions are useful to help reach a diagnosis and a treatment or at least how to reduce it occurence. 

In many cases, abdominal pain after sex is bearable and often resolves within minutes and not life-threatening, while others maybe severe and long lasting. However if the pain becomes too severe it can lead to avoidance of sex.

Some common causes are immediately clear and others might require a detailed discussion with your physician and lab investigations where necessary, to get to the root.

Some known causes (in no particular order) are deep penetration, orgasm (dysorgasmia), urinary tract infections (UTI), sexually transmitted infection (STI), interstitial cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ovarian cyst, uterine fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), endometriosis are some conditions that might result in painful sex or post-coital sex.

Therefore, tracking your periods is a significant part of knowing when your ovulation is expected to be. 

Some helpful signs of Ovulation are as follows; 
 - a raise in basal body temperature,
 - if you use a home ovulation kit, you will notice increased levels of luteinizing hormone (LH),
 - cervical mucus, or vaginal discharge, may appear clearer, thinner, and stretchy, like raw egg whites
 - breast tenderness
 - a feeling of being bloated 
 - possible light spotting
 - and slight pain or cramping in your side

When a person spends long hours looking at electric screens in general; television, computers, tablets or in your case; mobile phones, they tend to develop what is known as digital eye strain which is associated with exhaustion, back and neck pain and in most cases the eyestrain leads to headaches. 

The eye strain might be due to glare on the screen, poor lighting in your surrounding, improper computer brightness and color, or a combination of these factors.

Usually, when this is that case, we advise that you take frequent breaks from screen time, adjust your posture by walking a short distance to stretch your neck, arms, and back to improve circulation. You can also incorporate deep breathing lessons and short meditation time. You should also ensure that you are using appropriate screen glare protectors, the right chair and desk etc. 

In most cases, these techniques tend to help with the headaches and offers relief, however, if you believe the eyestrain is a becoming worse, hindering you daily activities or not entirely due to the screen time, I recommend you see an eye doctor.

Good morning. 

In addition to what my colleague has said, in relation to the abdominal cramps, what is the location? lower abdomen? Upper abdomen?

ANy associated urinary symptoms like pain when urinating?

For most women, they tend to have some cramps before the menses actually flow out. 

I advise you do a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy and also see a doctor to make sure the cramps you have is not due to an infective process. 

If you are stressed, you may want to relax a bit.

Good evening. 

Watery or milky discharge from the breasts when one is not pregnant is not normal. 

There is a condition called hyperprolactinaemia, where the prolactin levels in the blood is high and usually results to this. 

Prolactin is a hormone that is responsible for a woman to lactate or produce breast milk after child delivery. 

Other causes include a pituitary tumour, hypothroidism, liver disease and kidney disease. 

I advise that you go and see a doctor for a detailed history and physical examination. You would also need to do some tests to ascertain the hormonal levels and even rule other other conditions. 

Treatment would depend on the outcome of your visit to the doctor.

Combination 3 is a type of contraceptive pill that has about 2 different type of drugs in it to help prevent pregnancy, they are relatively safe, but there could be some side effects from its usage in the short and long term. There could be bleeds, headache, nausea etc they can also cause blood clots in the leg especially in people who are not very active, they can also affect the regularity of the menses once in a while. The truth is there is no 100% safe contraception, they just have differing benefits over one another. You can consider getting an intrauterine implant which usually has no hormonal effect on the body and can help prevent pregnancy for as much as 10 years, you can remove once you want to get pregnant. Best way to go about this is to visit the family planning clinic at any government Hospital or health centre around you and the nurses there will guide you on making the most appropriate choice for you.

There are however numerous treatment plans which includes surgical excision, intralesional steroid injection, radiation therapy, laser therapy, silicone gel sheeting, and pressure therapy.

Your concern is understandable, since there are different skin changes that might be mistaken by an untrained eye to look like genital warts. Differential diagnosis may include syphilis. 

Human Papilloma Virus (the causative agent of genital warts) is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, and because HPV can infect areas that are not covered by the condom, condoms will not fully protect you against contracting HPV, but condoms do help in reducing the chances of contracting HPV. 

In most cases, for genital warts to be diagnosed, a doctor has to examine and physically check a man''s genital area to see if warts are present, doctors may apply a vinegar solution to help identify warts that aren''t raised and visible. Afterwards, a treatment regimen is discussed and offered.

I''m not a doctor but I will advise based on experience. 

1. The mother should take food such as pap, beverages (milk + milo/bournvita etc if you''re in Nigeria), and other food that contains plenty fluid to aid breast milk flowing. 

2. Mother should position the breast to baby''s mouth; the more baby attempts to suck, the quicker the flow of breast milk. 

3. If no milk flow yet, baby should be placed on NaN 1 milk. It is available in any supermarket. Immediately breast milk starts flowing, NaN 1 should be stopped. 

I am not very sure about the safety of honey for infants less than 1 year old but water with glucose is advised to be given if you couldn''t get NaN 1 and milk is yet to flow. This will prevent baby from starvation which could be fatal.

Do you itch all over your body or just in specific areas; your vagina/vulva region? 

Vaginal itch during your period is a common experience. It often is attributed irritation from your menstrual products or hormonal imbalances. 

To avoid or lessen itch from irritation;
- use unscented tampons or pads
- change your tampons and pads frequently
- use the appropriate size tampon/pad for your flow, avoiding highly absorbent sizes if not necessary
- avoid using scented products, such as scented cleansing wipes, in your vaginal area
- wash the area with only water and mild soap with no color or scent.

As for hormonal changes occurring around your period, this can cause vaginal pH to change therefore creating an environment for yeast overgrowth. Along with itch, other symptoms of a yeast infection may be present; 

- discomfort when you pee
- swelling and redness
- cottage cheese-like vaginal discharge

Yeast infections are typically treated with antifungal medication which you may get over the counter at a pharmacy. 

All in all, this is not an uncommon situation, however, if the itching becomes unbearable or nonstop, it might be the sign of a condition that should be diagnosed and treated by your doctor. Go and see a gynaecologist.

Is it itching worse with warm or cold water?   

Usually, itching after a shower is due to the associated dryness of the skin. This is a form of aquagenic pruritus.  Also, some allergies manifest in the form of itching which may occur with or without rashes or skin changes when the body.  It is also possible that some viral or fungal infections of the skin can cause generalised itching with or without rashes after a shower.   

To reduce its occurrence, you should avoid excessive dryness of the skin by using towels less often and preferably allowing your body air dry, applying a moisturising lotion immediately after a bath, change your soap/ shampoo to hypoallergenic ones, and do not use hard sponges or scrub less vigorously. 

My advice is that you do the above and if you don’t get positive results, you should visit a dermatologist who will examine your skin, investigate the cause and provide an appropriate treatment/prevention regimen.

The “blood” you are referring to is called lochia. It is a normal expectation after delivery and this discharge usually contains blood, mucus, and soft tissue. This is how the body removes all of the extra blood and tissue from the uterus that helped the baby grow.

Lochia discharge typically continues for four to six weeks after childbirth, a time known as the postpartum period. Bleeding is heaviest the first few days after the baby is born but becomes lighter over days. It varies from person to person and pregnancy to pregnancy. 

Although it’s a normal occurence, if you see large clots (darkish things) or experience very heavy flow  that soaks through a maxi pad within an hour, please go and see your doctor or nurse. 

This should not be mistaken with postpartum haemorrhage, which is a more serious condition and requires urgent care.

What you might be describing are sunken eyes and considering you are concerned now that means this is a new occurrence, yes? 

So when did it start or when did you notice it? Are you presently ill or under a lot of stress? How old are you? 

Usually sunken eyes are sometimes associated with dark shadows or circles around the eyelids and an overall tired or fatigued look in the face. 

Some causes of sunken eyes as as follows; 
- Aging
- Chronic weight loss
- Poor sleep or other sleep disturbances
- Chronic dehydration
- Allergies

Good evening. 

As regards neonatal jaundice of the 3 day old baby, i would advise that the child be taken to the hospital and assessed by a doctor, possibly a pediatrician. 

It is very pertinent that the serum bilirubin levels of the  child be estimated and the appropriate treatment instituted for the baby. 

Treatment actually depends on the level of jaundice and not every jaundice is amenable to sunlight therapy. 

In some cases, the baby might even require exchange blood transfusion or simply phototherapy. Jaundice not well treated, can lead to permanent brain damage which is usually for life. This is called Kernicterus. 

So kindly advise them to take the child to the hospital. 

I hope this helps.

Husky voice or hoarseness of the voice is usually a symptom of disorders related to the vocal folds and in most cases is expected to clear in a few weeks.

Only tests can confirm pregnancy, and considering your test was positive, you might be pregnant or maybe it a false positive. 

My advise is to repeat the test at a reputable lab for confirmation. 

Also, please note that bleeding or spotting is possible despite being pregnant and this can occur anytime from conception (when the egg is fertilized) to the end of pregnancy. 

Light bleeding during early pregnancy happens due to the attachment of the fertilized egg to the uterine lining, this is known as implantation bleeding. It usually occurs during the time when you are expecting a normal menstrual period, it is generally lighter in comparison to menstrual bleeding. Implantation bleeding is usually light, stops spontaneously and doesn’t need treatment.

Go and confirm your pregnancy status.

*One of the most important things to do is to note what food or substances trigger the vomiting or cause irritation and try to avoid them. 

*Another thing that can help is for you to eat small pieces of food over a period rather than a big mean at once.

If you notice that your vomiting gets severe and you are feeling weak, kindly ask to be taken to the hospital for monitoring to ensure you are nurses back to stability.

In most cases, bleeding between periods is not usually a cause for concern. This is referred to as ‘spotting’, and it’s usually light bleeding. You may notice light brown spotting in your underwear or a heavy flow resembling a regular period. 

Although the reasons for irregular bleeding can vary according to individual health situations, pregnancy, birth control, or underlying infection, common causes of spotting include; 

contraceptive use: especially during the first few months of starting a new method. 

pregnancy: spotting is a common symptom of early pregnancy, known as implantation bleeding

physical conditions and infections: spotting can also be caused by infections and physical changes in the reproductive tract, or hormonal imbalances, seen in conditions like fibroids, uterine or cervical polyps, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) etc. 

spotting can also occur around ovulation and/or hormonal issues

Considering this is the first time you are noticing it, and there are no other symptoms, I will advice you monitor it and not any other changes around your menstrual cycle, however, if it continues, you should speak to to gynaecologist for review and examination.

By contraceptive pill, can I assume you mean an emergency pill (like postinor-2) taken after unprotected sex? 

If that’s the case, there are no life threatening effects to multiple use in most cases but like everything else we must use in moderation. These are hormonal drugs and too much of it will definitely affect the body adversely in one form or another. 

Most commonly, it could make the period irregular, which is not ideal if one is trying to avoid pregnancy. For someone in a sexually monogamous relationship who really wants or needs to keep from getting pregnant, relying only on emergency contraceptive pills is not an effective or cheap method. There are various options of contraceptives asides condoms that you and your partner might be eligible to get. 

I advise you speak to a family planning specialist to discuss your options.

There are various tests that can be done to check on the health of the lungs and heart; and this usually depends on the reason for the check. Some tests can give an idea of both the lungs and heart while there may be some specific to each of them. 
For example:
• A Chest X-ray will view both heart and lungs, as well as well as a computerized tomography or CT scan; and a Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)
• An electrocardiogram or ECG (testing the electrical activity of the heart) and echocardiogram (looking at the flow of blood through the heart) will test just the heart
• Spirometry (assessing the lung capacity) will test just the lungs
• There are blood tests too that can give an idea of heart and lungs functions by means of markers like troponins.

Sorry about your complaint. Masturbation is meant to be a safe practice but once it comes with a complaint, it''s good to seek help like you just did.

Even though, I may not have come across may complains of this nature, I will suggest these possible causes:
• Being vigorous while performing the act and as such exerting some traume to the scrotum and hence the testicles which could lead to inflammation, which in turn manifests as a swelling. For this I will recommend being gentle and making sure you use enough lubricant while masturbating.
• Being excessive with the act, and possibly minor trauma to the scrotum could compound over time and lead to the swelling like the explanation above. For this, I will recommend the same as above and in addition, try reducing the frequency of masturbation. If you think it''s interfering with personal life, look for any triggers and replace them with different activities, like going out and hanging out with loved ones. This will give you less time alone and reduce the frequency of masturbating.
• The presence of a scrotal or testicular disease which may be noticed mostly after masturbating. If you are experiencing symptoms like pain, painful urination, discharge, the swelling is increasing over time, visit a doctor (preferably a urologist) ASAP.

You’re most likely to get gas by eating foods such as; 
* Beans
* Vegetables (especially broccoli, cabbage, and onions)
* Fruits
* Dairy products
* Whole-grain foods
* Soft drinks
* Fruit drinks

Other ways to reduce flatulence include:
Eating smaller meals, eating slowly, avoiding gum and carbonated drinks, not smoking, choosing low-lactose dairy products, doing exercises and use of probiotics.

Sometimes, there is an underlying medical condition that needs urgent attention, such as food poisoning or an intestinal blockage. Gallbladder problems and constipation also worsens flatulence.

Good afternoon. 

reading through your symptoms, let us try to break them down a bit. 

Firstly, the palpitations, how long has it been going on? how old are you?  are you hypertensive? Are you diabetic ?

Typically, palpitations are pointers to a heart problem but there are other causes of palpitation that must be looked at.  Some of them include : 
 stress, anxiety or panic attacks.
conditions like hyperthyroidism. 
Depression.
Strenuous exercise.
Stimulants, including caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamines, and cold and cough medications that contain pseudoephedrine.
Fever.
Hormone changes associated with menstruation, pregnancy or menopause. 

You may want to look at these if any affects you. 

For the headache, this could be the result of so many things also notably stress, fatigue, fever, too much screen time and malaria ( which you need to be tested for). 

Fainting attacks could be from the palpitation. it could also result from hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar). make sure you eat as at when due. 

These being said, I suggest you see a doctor for a thorough examination and some blood work. You maybe requested to do an ECG ( which checks how fine your heart is working). 

This would be followed by treatment with medications if necessary or referral to a specialist.

Good afternoon. Sorry about your worry. 

Have you seen a doctor? How long has this been going on? Waht time of the day is the itching more intense?  Do you share clothing items with your brother or friends? 

And the boils? How long and the distribution? 

I suggest that you see a doctor as soon as possible for proper evaluation and treatment. sometimes what you describe as boil maybe something else. 

In the meantime, I advise you to observe strict hygiene practices like bathing at least twice a day, do not share clothes, change your underwears twice a day at least, do not share soap and sponge. you may want to get some antihistamine to help with the itching. 

Please also ask your brother to see the doctor with you so that he can be treated too. 

I hope this helps.

Cough and catarrh are symptoms of different illnesses, most commonly upper respiratory infection. 

Most times, the infection is usually of a viral nature, and in that case,  treatment is primarily with rest and fluid to let the body fight the infection on its own. In the presence of fever, over-the-counter anti-inflammatory pain relievers such as paracetamol helps. 

Drugs like night nurse contain antihistamines which often make people drowsy, but they block the effect of "histamine," and help relieve such annoying symptoms as sneezing, itching, and catarrh.

Eggs are a good source of nutrients and one of the healthiest foods out there. However, it’s one of the foods that has brought about a lot of debate especially regarding whether it is good or bad.

An egg a day should not be harmful to a healthy individual. Some feeding patterns even recommend more than 1 egg a day. Some people use eggs in their daily meals as part of weight loss regimens. Bodybuilders who want to bulk up tend to also consume a lot of eggs. 

Just like everything, moderation is key and listening to your body too is important. You may want to look for any unfavourable changes to your body while you consume eggs or any other foods. Many people are unaware that there is something like “egg allergy” for example. But I’m supposing you don’t have that.

Good morning. Sorry about your worry. 

Eczema can be quite a problematic skin characterized mostly by irritation. 

Again, it is good for that diagnosis to be made by a doctor for you as it may be something else as skin lesions may look similar but mean different things. 

I highly recommend that you see a dermatlogist ( skin doctor) and have it checked out. 

Meanwhile, you can try these out for some relief prior to seeing the doctor. 

take lukewarm baths

apply a  moisturizer within 3 minutes of bathing to "lock in" moisture

wear cotton and soft fabrics, and avoiding rough, scratchy fibers and tight-fitting clothing

use a mild soap or a non-soap cleanser when washing
air drying or gently patting skin dry with a towel, rather than rubbing the skin dry after bathing

where possible, avoiding rapid changes of temperature and activities that make you sweat

learn and avoid  individual eczema triggers

use a humidifier in dry or cold weather
keeping fingernails short to prevent scratching from breaking the skin.

Secondary infertility (the inability to conceive or achieve a term pregnancy after having a baby) can be a distressing problem with couples. And I can only imagine how you and your wife feel.

The possible causes for this are similar to those for a couple who have never had a baby before. These include:
- The frequency of sexual intercourse
- Abnormalities in sperm production and characteristics for the man as well as ovulation issues in the woman
- Abnormalities with the reproductive organs like testicular diseases in the man and fallopian tube issues like blockages in the woman
- Body weight changes, Ages of the couple etc
- Complications from the last pregnancy

These are a few of the possible causes that could exist. Have you both been visiting a fertility clinic together? It is important that you both go together as it also serves as a good support mechanism. And if you''ve visited a clinic before and there has been no issues detected, KEEP TRYING! 

Wellvis has experts in Gynaecology who can be of assistance, if you are interested and will love to be referred to them for a more personalized check up and assistance. So feel free to indicate any interest and hope you both achieve success in conceiving.

The bumps may be as a result of the shaving with a blade. Usually when using a blade or shaving stick, the upper part of the skin may break and permit entry of bacteria or fungal organisms which cause a skin infection around the area. And it may take a while for the infection to be cleared. That is probably why you still have the bumps. 

As for the underwear, the itchy feeling has more to do with the material than the color. Cotton or wooly materials will release particles of the skin of the area causing more itching.

Vaginal infections are a group of infections that affect the vagina. It could be caused by different types of bacteria, or viruses, it can also be from yeast. 
Therefore it is important to understand the exact cause, so one can get treated and then avoid getting it again. 

Although diagnosing them can be tricky especially without tests, but symptoms often help to narrow the cause and type of infection down; 
do you have any vaginal discharge? what colour? how heavy? what smell? any sensation of itching, burning, swelling, or soreness around or outside of your vagina? does it burns when you pee? any history of similar symptoms in the recent past? does you partner have any other complaints? etc. 

Meanwhile, to help reduce the symptoms and reoccurrence, the following can help; 
- keep your vaginal area dry,
- wipe from front to rear after using the toilet,
- switch to looser-fitting cotton underwear,
- avoid regular tight-fitting jeans or pantyhose,
- avoid chemical irritants in deodorized tampons, 
- do not use douches or feminine hygiene products as regular bathing is usually adequate to cleanse the vagina.

Short Answer - a lot of things. 

Chest pain and pain in general can have causes that are due to diseases of the underlying organs (referred or radiated pain) or just be musculoskeletal in nature. Cause of musculoskeletal pain include heavy lifting, weight lifting, blunt trauma etc. 

Chest pain is never something to ignore, particularly because you have referred to it as severe. There are a lot of organs in the chest region and it might be due to diseases of any of these organs, also note that it might not be. 
How would you describe this pain? Is it permanent or it comes and goes? On a scale of 1 - 10, how would you score it? How long have you had it? Any dizziness spells? Any other symptoms? Is it affecting your breathing? These are some of the questions a doctor will need answers to while also examining you and maybe requesting for some labs. 

Anyway, my point is quite a few medical conditions are characterised by symptoms of chest pain; disease of the heart, lungs, gastrointestinal system, muscles and bones of the chest region, even panic attacks etc. therefore if you have sever chest pain for no known reason, please see your doctor for review, investigations and treatment ASAP. 

The same thing for the lower back pain, but this is commonly as a result of strain of the muscles and ligaments in the lower back which can stretch or tear due to excess activity, or poor posture. Disc injuries or inflammation of the joints of the spine are also common causes. Your doctor will ask for your age, your past medical history, day to day activités etc. to help reach a diagnosis. Meanwhile, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers, stretching and massages, use ice packs or warm water bottles for the pain while you prepare to get a physical evaluation from a doctor.

Good to have you here. 
Apart from urinating frequently, I would like to ask if you have any other symptoms like 
-pain while urinating
-how many times do you urinate in an hour? 
-do you find it difficult to hold urine unlike before necessitating you to rush down to the toilet asap? 
If any of these coexist with your symptom,  you might have a Urinary Tract Infection(UTI) and would advise you see your doctor asap to do some tests for confirmation and treatment.

Considering the fact that you are close to term/delivery,  having symptoms suggestive of UTI and experiencing something that feels like a contraction,  I advise you see your  doctor ASAP because an untreated UTI might make you fall into labour earlier than expected.

- water dripping down your legs esp when you attempt to use the toilet,  cough etc

-consistent painful intermittent contractions of the womb lasting less than a minute and noticeable by the hardening of your womb when you touch your abdomen/tommy.

To clarify a few things - did these headchaes only start to occur after you discovered you had "low blood"? Or was it the headaches that prompted you to seek care and make you discover?
Also, where were you told this and did they offer you any supplement pills or advice on how you should eat certain kinds of food to help with the blood levels? Furthermore, did you have any more tests done to discover whether any other causes might be attributable to the low blood levels.

The headaches can indeed be a symptom of the low blood level but it is highly important that the underlying cause of the low blood level be attended to. How well have you followed the dietary advice given since you said the cause was attributed to not eating well.

If no advice was given on food, please note that a few meals you can access easily to eat include- beef, chicken liver, fish, you can also be on the lookout for iron fortified cereals and bread. You might also want to try painkillers like paracetamol just to help with your headache short term.

Sores in the genital area have many causes but when combined with the other symptoms listed; itchiness and associated painful urination plus a history of unprotected sex, it is a high chance of STI. 

My advice is to visit a doctor for physical examination and lab investigations to find the exact cause and be treated accordingly. 

Meanwhile, you have to discuss with your boyfriend so he can seek medical attention too and prevent reinfecting you after treatment or to transmit it to other sexual partners. It is best that you do not have sex until the sores have subsided and until you have completed your treatment.

Only that  it is safe to delay elective dental treaments  until after delivery,in women still  in their  1st  or  3rd trimesters.This is because of a  couple of factors viz:The risk of  exposure of the  foetus  in the first trimester of pregnancy to radiation from dental xray and also, the risk of orthostatic hypotension hence the resultant  syncope that is likely to  happen when a  heavily  pregnant woman sits on the dental chair for  long while undergoing dental treatment.
However,while  dentists would take adequate measures to reduce these risks, dental treatment could still be done during pregnancy(depending on the severity  of the patient''s symptoms and also, depending on  whether the said treament is invasive or noninvasive).
As for the  dental treatments which might warrant postponement until after delivery,such treatments can be done anytime after delivery as long as  the woman has been certified fit by her doctors to go home.
Even though there is no time frame,a dentist could decide to wait for three months depending on the emotional readiness of the patient and other patient- based factors.

Sorry about what you are experiencing and you''ve come to the right place for advice.

You have done a good job noticing these details about the pain in your leg and possible trigger (running). And I also see that this jogging/running is part of your weight loss journey (Congrats by the way for this bold step). 

However, your body is sending you a signal to take it gradually, and I will recommend you do so. You can still get moving by doing walking. Brisk walking is almost as effective as jogging as it gets your heart and muscles of your body working. 

Doing any exercise with discomfort is a recipe for issues in future. You may have a muscle tear, a sprain etc. Take it gradually, do brisk walking and then as you proceed you can blend some walking with some jogging as you proceed, just so you do not overwhelm your body. Also, taking rest days in between is important to get your body recovered and rebuilt injured tissues.

I also hope this is not affecting your way of walking (from normal to limping), your posture (the way you stand) or spreading to other parts of your left lower limb (your left thigh, your left foot) or beyond.

Just a little tip on weight loss, remember to eat healthy too. Exercise compliments a healthy diet and the results are amazing.

There are different ways to calculate your due date; 

You can use your last menstrual period (LMP). The number of weeks that have passed since the first day of your last period indicates how old in weeks your pregnancy is. To work out your likely due date, count 280 days (40 weeks) from the first day of your last period.

Using the first ultrasound scan during your antenatal visit, your healthcare provider will also check on fetal growth and monitor other development milestones. Ultrasound scans ALSO provides the most accurate estimate for how many weeks pregnant you are and what your due date will be. This is the MOST RELIABLE method and is particularly useful if you don’t know the date of your last period or if your menstrual cycles are irregular.

Nausea and vomiting are common in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, usually referred to as morning sickness. In some cases, some pregnant women experience excessive nausea and vomiting that might result in hospitalisation from dehydration. 

Seek medical help if vomiting is so severe or constant that the person can’t keep down fluids or food. The doctor may need to treat you for dehydration and may recommend medication to control vomiting during pregnancy.

Good morning and sorry about the sprain. It takes a while for sprains to heal completely sometimes up to three weeks or more. 

This depends largely on activity of the affected limb. Excessive usage will lengthen the time it takes to heal. 

I suggest that you do not try to run for now and allow it heal properly. You can also use some analgesics to help with the pain. 

Another thing is I suggest is see a doctor and probably have an X-ray done. There have been cases like this where one keeps managing sprain meanwhile there is a fracture in the affected limb.

First of all, I cannot speak categorically on this, but there is almost no chance that she would have been tested with a used needle, especially in a facility such as UCH. Also, all needles are discarded after use. Usually, we encourage people insist that a new needle or lancet is opened in their presence just before the test is done. 

If nothing else happened outside the history you have given and no other chances of exposure to HIV had occurred, I don’t see the need for PEP. Is she still on the drug?

Ovulation typically lasts about 48hours (2 days)

Ovulation is associated with an increase in vaginal discharge that is usually clear and stretchy. Other associated symptoms may include; light bleeding or spotting, breast tenderness, increased sexual drive, ovary pain on one side of the abdomen. 	

PMS signs tend to appear in the two weeks before your next period and slowly disappears after your period. Joint pains and muscles are not characteristic signs of PMS but it varies in different women. Are these your usual PMS signs?

A couple of things could cause painful sex. 

It could be that your vagina isn''t properly lubricated. This causes bruising and injuries leading to pain. 

The force of penetration could also be an issue. The more the force, the more painful it is. 

Also there could be some previous injuries you sustained which have not healed and they get bruised during penetration. 

There''s also something called vaginismus. It''s a condition where there is constant and excessive contraction of the vaginal muscles during sex. 

But you can only be diagnosed after proper examination so I advise you to see a gynecologist who will examine and treat you.

What you have described is what is called dyspareunia; pains during sexual intercourse.  For some women, the pain is only a temporary problem; for others, it is a long-term problem.

To better understand this condition, you have to provide answers to certain personal questions such as age, sexual history and habits, any history of sexual violence etc. This will help to narrow the possible cause and subsequent management protocols. 

Oftentimes, the pain results from inadequate vaginal lubrication firing sex, which is often resolved when the woman becomes more relaxed, when sufficient amount of foreplay is introduced or if the couple uses a lubricant.

Other reasons for painful sex may include one or more of the following; 

1. Vaginismus, which is the involuntary spasm of the vaginal muscles, usually due to a underlying fear. 
2. Vaginal infections, such as yeast infections may also result in intermittent sexual pains. 
3. Cervical, uterus and ovarian changes or deformities such as cysts, polyps and fibroids can lead to pain especially at deep penetration.
4. Endometriosis
5. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). With PID, the tissues deep inside become badly inflamed and the pressure of intercourse causes deep pain.
6. During menopause the vaginal lining can lose its normal moisture and become dry. 
7. Vulvodynia, a chronic pain that affects a woman''s external sexual organs. 

As stated earlier, treatment is based on the identified cause. Meanwhile, make sure to practice gentleness and patience, use sufficient amounts of water-based lubricants.

All symptoms including mood changes must be discussed with your physician/obstetrician-gynaecologist as they can be help with diagnosis. In some cases you might require sexual therapy and interventions to manage past sexual and non sexual traumas.

Please I hope you pregnancy termination was being handled by a trained professional. Good job, if it is.

To confirm if you’re still pregnant, an ultrasound scan will need to be done to confirm that any product of conception is out. A urinary test will usually be positive for over a week even after termination of pregnancy.

I am sorry about your experience, this can be caused by long term constipation, which will make the stools hard and difficult to push out. One of the things that can help is the eating a lot of vegetables and drinking lots of water, this can help soften and make the stools easier to pass, or you can get laxatives at a pharmacy, they are available over the counter if this doesn''t work, then please visit a doctor physically for assessment. About the feeling that you still have more stool left inside when you stool, I would advise that this might necessitate a visit to the doctor for physical assessment to know why that happens.

Midlife crisis isn’t officially a medical diagnosis, and because there is no specific sets of symptoms or signs to specifically diagnose midlife crisis, doctors tend to have a difficult time addressing it.  
However, what we can do is to rule out identifiable health issues based on the symptoms you are experiencing; either physically or mentally, and to ensure that it is indeed just a midlife crisis and not a manifestation of an underlying illness. 

My advice is to visit a physician for review, have a discussion regarding the symptoms and signs you are experiencing and possibly have a medical checkup.

When someone is newly infected with HIV, the person may not show symptoms because the virus has not multiplied to the extent of causing symptoms. If the person is tested, the virus may not be detected. This is called the window period and it usually lasts for about 3 months.

However, subsequently, the person may begin to have fever(rise in body temperature), headaches, diarrhea. Seed like tissues called lymphnodes around the body may get enlarged and painful. The person begins to fall sick easily because the immune system is weak.

Good morning. 

Throat pains could mean that there is an infection going on in your throat. it could be the tonsils that are inflammed giving you the pain or the walls of the throat in the area we call the pharynx are inflammed causing you pains. 

Best course of action is to take some analgesics like paracetamol and head to the hospital where a doctor will see you and evaluate you properly. He would   need to look into your throat to ascertain the problem and maybe run a couple of tests.

Sorry about what you are experiencing. It could as a result of a number of things including hormonal imbalance, and seeing a dermatologist if it persists is the best way to proceed. 

However, you can get some over the counter acne medications from a reputable pharmacy. Speak to the pharmacist for medications like 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin gel, which can be applied twice daily and wash skin with Dove bar. Also, drink a lot of water.

I understand you are used to an exact duration or date of your menstrual cycle/flow. But occasionally, it is possible to have a delay by few days especially when you are not pregnant. One of the things that could cause this is stress. Stress alters the normal body hormonal levels leading to delay in menstrual flow. 

Another thing is contraceptive medications. If you are on any form of contraception whether planned or emergency, it can affect your flow.

Sometimes, nothing may be wrong. The body is not exactly a programmed system where certain things MUST occur at FIXED times. It may just be a little delay which will correct itself. 

But be rest assured that you will see your flow.

weight and diet: losing or gaining a large amount of weight will alter your menstrual cycle

Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a procedure that is performed during in vitro fertilisation (IVF); a form of assisted reproductive technology. 

IVF is the process of fertilisation by extracting eggs from a woman and retrieving a sperm sample from the man and manually combining them to form an embryo (babies develop from embryo). The embryo(s) is then transferred / implanted into the uterus of the mother. 

With PGD, the genetic makeup of each embryo can be determined before being transferred into the uterus of the woman during IVF, therefore almost completely eliminating the risks of bearing a child with sickle cell. Please note that PGD is not 100% accurate. 

Other options are prenatal diagnosis which is usually done while the couple is already pregnant, it involves selective abortion of affected pregnancies. And is significantly cheaper. 

Cost of the procedure differs based on location, centre and health status of the couple. However it is said to be in the millions (or Naira). 

Speak to your primary physician or gynaecologist if you would like to consider this.

No, getting a Pap smear doesn’t ‘take’ your virginity. 
Virginity has a personal definition, it is not a medical or physical condition. People are commonly considered virgins if they’ve never had penetrative sex. 

Please note that hymens can be stretched open the first time during vaginal sex, sometimes causing some pain or bleeding, this however, is not always the case for everyone. There are other ways that a hymen can be stretched open: riding a bike, doing sports, or putting something in the vagina accidentally to on purpose (like a tampon or during a Pap smear). When the hymen is stretched open, it doesn’t grow back.

Virginity and the presence of a closed hymen are not mutually exclusive, therefore you can’t tell if someone has had sex by the way their hymen looks or feels. Some people are born with hymens that are naturally open, also there are many other activities besides sex can stretch your hymen.

How and when were you diagnosed with diabetes? How and where have you been monitoring your blood sugar? Do you own a glucometer? Do you check before or after a meal? 

Symptoms of diabetes vary and this is often dependent on how elevated your blood sugar is. In many cases when blood sugar is only slightly elevated you might not have any discernible physical symptoms. However, when significantly elevated or long lasting, signs and symptoms of diabetes may include the following; drinking more water, increased urination, high thirst and hunger, weight loss, regular tiredness, eye problems, injuries that doesn’t heal quickly and frequent infections. 

Complications of diabetes develop gradually, and the longer you have uncontrolled blood sugar, the higher the risks of complications. They can be disabling and life-threatening. They include cardiovascular problems such as coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). Nerve damage which may lead to loss of all feelings and sensations in the limbs and in men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction. Damage to the kidneys, eye etc. may also occur. 

Ideally, a test called Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test is the best way to know what your diabetic status. You should visit your doctor or a lab and request for this test. You should also repeat a fasting and 2hours post prandial blood sugar at a reputable centre to confirm diagnosis. 

Meanwhile, ensure that you eat healthy foods that are low in fat and calories but higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Get more physical activity, of about 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day such as brisk daily walks or swimming. And don’t forget to aim to lose some body weight to reduce the risk of diabetes.

A little blister is very subjective. What you have referred to as a “little blister” might be big enough for serious concern. 
Blisters or sores on the labia sometimes happen due to friction and resolve on their own, while sometimes it may be due to certain skin disorders or as symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI).

The associated pelvic pain and pain during penetration/ intercourse is very suggestive of an STI. 
You will need a physical examination and tests to identify the actual cause and a definitive diagnosis. It is also important to find out if the cause is an STI and subsequently treat to avoid spreading it to sexual partners. 
You are advised to abstain from sexual activities for now. 

Please note that untreated STIs can cause serious health complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, scarring of the reproductive organs and an increased risk for ectopic pregnancy

The symptoms you have described are quite specific for “vaginal infections” most likely a sexually transmitted one and less likely a urinary tract infection. 

However a definite diagnosis can only be obtained following history, physical examination and investigations (a high vaginal swab m/c/s) which will also give details of the best medications to use in treating and eliminating the causative agent.

Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can be deadly if not treated early enough.
The virus is passed from person to person through blood, semen or other body fluids.
Commonly spread by sexual contact, sharing of needles, or from mother to child.

Having a chronic HBV infection can lead to serious complications, such as: the scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver cancer or liver failure.

Once diagnosis has been made, treatment modalities or management is determined by your doctor, preferably a gastroenterologist, based on duration of the virus; acute or chronic. Antiviral medications and liver supplements are offered in treatment.

Please note that the ''washing" that was done is a routine dental treatment that is supposed to be done  every 6 months and it removes  accummulated plaque,calculus and stains on the teeth.
Infact, even without having any dental complaint we need to have such a proceedure done every 6 months.It is like a way of cleaning  "dirts" in your   mouth.
Having said that,there are lots of factors that can cause teeth sensitivity (known as dentine hypersensitivity).Examples include factors like frequent consumption of acidic fizzy drinks,wrong brushing tehniques, to mention but a few.
Basically,the enamel  is the outermost,hardest and  protective layer of the teeth while the dentine (which is the next layer after the enamel)is not as strong.
In view of this,any insult to the tooth that degrades the enamel will expose the naturally sensitive dentine to further injury.That is why the sensitivity phenomenon is called "dentinal hypersensitivity''.

The age is important because Isolated color change an be a sign of dying tooth tissues.Such a  case of isolated color change is usually seen following trauma to the upper anterior teeth(as seen in falls,road traffic accidents and  playground accidents).
However when this happens,it is important to seek dental help so as to prevent early loss of that  milk/baby/deciduous tooth and also so as to intervene before any obstruction or damage to the underlying permanent anterior teeth occurs.

A false positive pregnancy test result is possible but not common; it is when the test is positive, but you are not pregnant. You may get this result if you are taking a medication that contains hCG (pregnancy-related hormones) or due to certain health issues.

My advise is to request a quantitative hCG test, also repeat the scan and a different centre and consult a gynaecologist for review on account of the fibroid and back ache.

It sounds like you might have a skin infection, possibly tinea corporis, known as “ringworm”. They cause circular shaped patches that often merge to form a bigger and less circular shape, it may turn flaky and scaly but is quite itchy. 

You should visit a dermatologist for review,  definitive diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. 

Meanwhile, you may get over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal cream, lotion, or powder to help reduce the itch. Also, ensure to keep your skin clean by showering multiple times a day and also ensure your skin and genital region is particularly dry because ringworm thrives in wet/moist areas, change your socks and underwear at least once each day, don’t share clothes or towels with someone who has ringworm and wash your hands with soap and water after playing with pets.

When there is poor blood circulation to the legs, it can result to cramps. This is one of the reasons you are advised not to sit down for very long hours at a stretch. 

Another reason is dehydration. You need to make sure you get in enough fluids into your system. 

Another cause is muscle fatigue which occurs whena muscle or group of muscles have been used repeatedly without allowing them time for adequate rest and recovery. 

Then for those who exercise, it is good to engage in warm up exercises before the main activitiy to make sure youdont develop cramps. 

Another cause is exercising in hot weather. This is not very helpful as one gets quickly dehydrated. 

 I hope this helps.

Good evening. 

Spotting in pregnancy is not a good sign. 

It could be a sign of a threatened miscarriage since you are just 5 weeks. 

Aside the spotting, any other problem like lower abdominal pains ? Painful urination ? Vaginal discharge ? 

And since you say it’s only when you take the omega 3 and pregnacare, you see it. I advise you stop the omega 3 and just stick to the pregnacare alone. 

I will also strongly advise that you go see your doctor. Have you registered for Antenatal ? If no, pls do ASAP! 

Omega 3 on its own is generally safe in pregnancy. You need to check if nothing else has been added to it.

Having some form of anxiety at one point or the other in our lives is a normal thing, especially in situations that we are unfamiliar with. The responses to anxiety varies. 
However, when symptoms of anxiety become larger than the events that triggered them and when they begin to interfere with your life, they could be signs of an anxiety disorder.

To diagnose anxiety disorders, you will have to speak to a medical professional such as a clinical psychologist or behavioural therapist, who will also help you identify coping mechanisms. 

Meanwhile, ensure you eat a healthy diet, limiting caffeine, abstaining from alcohol and smoking and also consider exercising regular and meditation. These have been known to help with anxiety issues.

Infections are the most common cause of swollen lymph nodes. 

Lymph nodes typically help the body fight off infections, they work by trapping microorganisms to prevent them from infecting other parts of your body. 
Swollen nodes in the groin can be caused by an injury or skin infection in the legs or foot, some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can also cause swollen lymph nodes in that area.

Do you have any other symptoms? Vomiting, rash, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, fatigue etc. Also, how long have you noticed it? Is it painful? 

In the absence of other symptoms, I wouldn’t be worried. 
I would ask that you monitor it and visit a doctor if it increases in size or there are noticeable growths of other lymph nodes (neck, armpits, back of your ears etc), or of it persists for up to 4 weeks and other symptoms appear. 

Meanwhile, resting and applying a warm, moist compress to the swollen area may help to relieve pain and swelling. Also, try to find the source (possibly an injury, if possible).

The lumps maybe something simple like ingrown hairs or razor bumps from shaving or more serious like genital warts from HPV. The fact that you have had unprotected sex also exposes you to the possibility of an STI like syphilis. 

You will be best served by visiting a physician for review and examination to rule out any of these causes and subsequently prescribe medications for you.

An eyelid boil can’t always be prevented.

As regards care, I expect the wound to be dry and well apposed at the edges. The chin has a rich supply of blood vessels so healing should be pretty fast. 

You can take your bath normal and maybe wipe your face for another 5 days to allow for proper healing. 

You can get vitamin c tablets or indulge a lot of fruits especially the citrus based ones. 

I hope this helps.

Good evening. Yes, anxiety can cause high blood pressure BUT just a momentary rise in blood pressure which normalizes after a while or when the source of the anxiety is gone. 

It is usually the body''s response to danger ( the flight, fight or fright syndrome). 

If one has a sustained increased in blood pressure over three measurements at different times, it warrants an investigation and physical examination by a doctor. 

Some causes of hypertension are obesity, alcohol, sedentary lifestyle, heart diseases, kidney diseases, endocrine diseases etc.... the cause needs to be found. 

As regards the anxiety, it is best that you talk to a mental health professional to help identify the root cause of the anxiety and get you treated.

The urge to urinate more frequently might be due to some causes. 

Firstly, if you have been taking in more fluids lately ( water) , you will definitely have the urge to urinate more. 

Secondly, a urinary tract infection may be the cause. The urge to urinate in urinary tract infections may or may not be accompanied by lower abdominal pains, and slight fever. 

Another possible cause can be diabetes. When last did you have your sugar checked? 

I suggest you go get a fasting blood glucose test done asap. 

In view of the possible Urinary tract infection, i strongly advise that you go see a doctor for a detailed history, examination and investigation, to ascertain the cause of the urge and get you treated appropriately.

A swelling below your vaginal lips could mean some things. It could be a lipoma ( which is an accumulation of fat cells), or it could be a Bartholin''s cyst. It can also be a wart ( genital ) or just another growth.

Good morning and top of the day. 

According to the producers of Fem Fresh, it has been designed to clean your vagina and make you feel fresh all day long. 

However, the vagina is a self-cleaning organ and does not really need help cleansing itself.

What we advise: When showering or bathing, wash your vulva with warm water and mild or unscented soap. 

Separate your labia and let the warm soapy water clean all around the clitoral hood and between your labia. 

These should help your vagina stay clean. Also change your underwear at least twice a day take a shower at least twice a day. 

Do not abuse medications especially antibiotics but take medications only on prescription.

Sorry about what you’re experiencing. Is this a recent occurrence? How long has this been for?

Do you indulge in foreplay before penetration? This may help delay the time to ejaculate. 

Also, have you discussed with your partner about this. It’s important you both have this discussion so you can work out ways to go through this.

Some schools of thought recommend slower strokes while penetrating during sex which increases the time to ejaculation. You can also do the stop-start method whereby you stop penetration for a bit and then proceed. 

While there exists medical products that may numb the sensation around the penis to allow you last longer, I’ll recommend you talk with a health professional before indulging in those.

There are actually a lot of causes of headache and they all have to be ruled out. This can be done by a visit to a doctor who will take a detailed history of the headache and order some more investigations like a brain scan to make sure that you don''t have any growths or swellings inside.

How long ago did this happen? Was it rapidly progressive? How stiff are the joints?

Most likely you may have had nerve damage that is the cause of your predicament. However, you need to be properly examined by a doctor to clearly determine this and make sure it is not caused by any other condition linked to your muscles. 

I suggest you book an appointment with a doctor. You will also need lots of physiotherapies to enable you to start moving. Joints stiffness is usually a complication of lack of use and will take some time to free up, and it has to be gentle and gradual. 

I hope this helps.

Sorry about how you feel and I can only imagine the worry you’re experiencing. However, I’ll want to tell you that a couple can only be considered infertile after they’ve been together for a year and engaged in regular sexual intercourse. By regular, I’m referring to at least three days a week.

So based on your timeline, you still have 6 months before any conclusions can be made. I believe it will benefit you and your wife to not give up and keep trying. And I’m hoping you’re not judging from the way it happens with other couples. Also, if your wife knows her menstrual cycle well, you may indulge in intercourse around when she’s ovulating.

We are here to help and are glad to give you the advise you and your wife seek. We offer a live chat service, at a reasonable charge, where you can have a direct online discussion with any of our verified doctors.

1: a couple cannot be considered as infertile until after a year of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. One has to put in mind, husband and wife living together. You can’t be apart and be expecting to get pregnant. 


Also, your emotional stability needs to be in perfect shape. If both of you keep thinking about not getting pregnant especially your wife it will affect her hormones which play a vital role in her getting pregnant. 

There are other things that need to be checked as well.

Regular menstruation
Age of the wife.
Lifestyle.
Past and current history of infection.

First of all, I hope you’re feeling much better following your recent surgery.

Regarding sexual activity, most surgeons recommend waiting a minimum of 4-6 weeks after surgery before having intercourse. This allows for the pain to subside and for the surgical wound to heal better. There are other factors involved depending on the reason for the surgery.

However, when you do resume sexual intercourse, it is recommended to wait for at least 6 months before getting pregnant (if you are trying to).

Your follow-up checks with your gynaecologist is very important and you should report any worrying symptoms like a high fever, nausea or vomiting, severe pain, bleeding from the surgical site, chest or breathing issues, abnormal vaginal discharge etc.

Also, moderate walking is helpful in your healing process and eating healthy too with high fibre, to avoid constipation.

Good evening. Sorry to read about your miscarriage. 

As regards trying to take in for the past 7months, there are a lot of things to consider. 

First, how often do you have sexual intercourse with your husband? 3 times a week is recommended. I am assuming that you both live together. 

Are you aware of your ovulation time? It is advised to meet around this time to increase the chances of getting pregnant. 

At what age of the pregnancy did the miscarriage happen? Was there any evacuation done? any complications?

I advise you to relax as you sound very worried and anxious. 

I would suggest that you go see a gynaecologist for a proper evaluation, though it is too early for us to start talking of infertility.

Itchy private part could signify a lot of things but usually, it is attributed to an ongoing infection. The discharge supports an infection as well. The blood stain could be as a result of "scratching" or from the infection of the private part also. 

There are important questions to help unravel this puzzle such as: your sexual activity (whether it is safe or not), the period of your cycle in which you are, general hygiene, recent antibiotic usage, recent treatment, and so on.

The best step to take now is to get to a hospital with a good laboratory and get a test done. This will help to know the culprit (bacteria, protozoa e.t.c) and to know the appropriate drug to use with the right dose and duration. 

Poorly treated infection usually have its attending long term complications.

Good evening. Sorry about your worries. Regarding anxiety, the key to managing anxiety is mainly by identifying your triggers and trying to avoid them. 

Some triggers include: 

a stressful job or work 
withdrawal from drugs or certain medications
side effects of certain medications
trauma

You may also want to try deep breathing exercises occasionally. It actually helps. 

If your job stresses you, consider getting a new one.

Sorry about the discomfort you are facing with your condition.

My reply will be on the assumption that the presence of the lipoma was confirmed my a trained health professional.

Lipomas are usually not harmful but cause aesthetic discomfort (as in your case) and occasionally get infected or are painful. Gladly you don’t seem to be affected by the last two. 

Generally, lipomas are removed under local anaesthesia as it’s a minor surgery.

Orchitis is an inflammation of the testicles. It can be caused by either bacteria or a virus. Also, the fact that you have had it for a year isn’t exactly in keeping with that particular diagnosis. 

My advise is that you visit a physician, preferably a urologist ASAP, who will examine you, possibly request some tests and prescribe appropriate medications, because I believe your condition might require immediate treatment to avoid permanent damage.', 13, 1046, 0, null, 0, '2020-02-15 16:03:06', '2020-02-15 16:03:06', null);

Sorry to hear about your worry and I hope I can be able to assist you with my reply.

A few questions will help make this guidance easier. How old are you and your husband? May I know if your husband is the father of your previous pregnancy?? If he’s not, how long have you been married for? Does he have any children? Did the previous pregnancy end in a successful delivery? Any history of contraception or family planning? How regular do you both have sexual intercourse? Have you visited a doctor with this issue?

Usually, secondary infertility (the inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to term after previously doing so) has similar causes and risk factors like primary infertility (inability to conceive after a year of regular intercourse in those who are having a first attempt). These include things like age, sperm abnormalities, Fallopian tube abnormalities, hormonal problems etc.

As a result, you and your partner need to visit a doctor to conduct the appropriate tests and investigations. The results will guide your management. I’ll encourage you and your partner to keep trying and seek the help you deserve.

Quick or premature ejaculation is relative. How long do you last? Is this a personal concern or has your partner also complained? 
When did this start and can you think of any significant event that surrounded the time it started? Are there any particular stressors in your life presently? Does this also occur when/if you masturbate? Are you on any medications?  

Without answers to these question, I’m unable to tell you the exact reason why you might be experiencing this, however, some changes to your sexual routine that may prove helpful are;  some men have being able to delay ejaculation when they masturbate within an hour before intercourse, while some completely avoided sex (temporarily) thus relieving the associated sexual pressures. The start-and-stop methods whereby you stop sex when you are close to ejaculation and only continue when you have regained control, the squeeze method, pelvic floor exercises and use of desensitising condoms are also practices that might help.

To reduce your risk of diabetes, you need to understand the risk and subsequently makes changes to your lifestyle. Lifestyle modification isn’t easy, but it’s definitely worth the effort. 

Some tips include;


1. See your doctor for regular check-ups. As you get older, it’s a good idea to regularly check your blood glucose, blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels.
2. Manage your weight. Increased body fat, especially around the abdomen, can worsen your risk 
3. Exercise regularly. Physical activity on helps manage weight, reduce blood glucose levels and may improve blood pressure and cholesterol.
4. Eat a balanced, healthy diet. Reduce the amount of fat in your diet, eat more fruit, vegetables and high-fibre foods. Reduce salt intake. Reduce fast-food, they are usually high in salt, fat and kilojoules. It’s best to cook for yourself using fresh ingredients whenever possible.
5. Limit your alcohol intake. Too much alcohol leads to weight gain and may increase your blood pressure
6. Quit smoking. Smokers are twice as likely to develop diabetes as non-smokers.
7. Control your blood pressure. Know your numbers

Although there is no specific time that indicates a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation, but when you are feeling frustrated and have to discontinue sex due to fatigue, loss of erection or a request from your partner, then this might be a case of delayed or impaired ejaculation. 

When did this delay start? Has it always been the case? Or did it start recently? 
Do you notice the delay during all sexual situations? All partners or just someone in particular? What about when you masturbate?
Are you on any medications or drugs; prescribed or social use eg marijuana/weed, tramadol etc. Or do you have any other symptoms? Are you under any kind of stress lately? Do you consume a lot of alcohol? 

Therapy and/or sexual counselling is most helpful in the absence of physical illnesses. It  can help address underlying mental health problems (if any) that may result in delayed ejaculation and provide options to na sexual anxiety.

EGA (estimated gestational age) on the other hand can roughly give you the age of the fetus, also counting from the first day of your last menstrual period. An ultrasound scan done early in the first trimester (before 10weeks) is usually the most accurate in dating a pregnancy.

That being said, I will advise you to discontinue the anti-inflammatory cream since it’s not working and especially now that the skin is broken.

Welcome to Wellvis,

Few questions will be asked to help you confirm that it is UTI and a possible test might be need to support it.
Have you noticed a recent increase in number of times you urinate? Is there any burning sensation or pain after or while urinating? Any fever? Did you conduct any test that confirmed or informed you that it''s UTI? Do you retain urine for long?

Sorry about what you are experiencing. It could as a result of a number of things including hormonal imbalance, and seeing a dermatologist if it persists is the best way to proceed.  However, you can get some over the counter acne medications from a reputable pharmacy. Speak to the pharmacist for medications like 2.5% benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin gel, which can be applied twice daily and wash skin with Dove bar. Also, drink a lot of water.   

Don’t forget that if it persists you should see a dermatologist. If you need help finding one you can request via this form;

You''ve done a good job trying to clarify what is going on with your friend. 
Cysts in general are growths in the body that may contain fluid, air or other substances. They usually are benign, that is, do not lead to cancer.
In the vagina, these can be from birth, trauma to the vagina (surgery, child birth) or obstructions of glands. There are usually no symptoms associated with cysts other than the presence of the lump which may be uncomfortable. Sometimes, there may be pain while bathing or even during sexual intercourse. The substance inside the cyst may become infected and develop into pus. In some cases, they may be cancerous (though rare). 
Most of these cysts do not require any treatment unless there is an increase in size, it is disturbing daily activities or there is a chance of it being cancerous. The most common treatment is surgery to remove the cyst and treatment of infections if any.
My recommendation will be for your friend to visit a gynaecologist to confirm the presence of cyst and to assess whether there is any need for an intervention.
You could get a head start with seeking direct assistance from one of our verified doctors here by using the CHAT function below. You can also send photos to aid in your explanation if you wish. We also offer a referral service to assist you in getting the best care you and your friend deserve.

These are some some non-specific symptoms, therefore it is difficult to reach a tentative diagnosis with just these symptoms because illnesses that might cause them vary significantly. 

Some questions that might help cone  down on possibly causes; any cough or fever? or any other symptoms; diarrhoea, discharge from any part of your body? when did these symptoms start? did they all start at the same time or some started before others? are they worse at a particular time of the day or relieved by particular activities or medications? do they symptoms come regularly or often? have you travelled outside the country within the past month? have you been exposed to mosquito bites or any other bites? what have you done since it started? 

Answers to these questions can help narrow the cause down. Meanwhile, get some rest, drink a lot of fluids and get some over the counter pain medication (use with food) and then antimalarial testing and treatment if possible.

You’ve done a great job with giving detailed information regarding your problem. First of all, I’ll urge you to stay calm and not panic.
Diagnosis of breast cancer needs to be done by your doctor after examining the affected breast (and surrounding regions) and requesting the relevant tests.
Also keep in mind that other conditions can cause the lump you experienced in your armpit, which I’m thinking is a lymph node. An infection for example, may cause that.
Regarding the lump, have you noticed any change in its size or texture since this incident?
I’ll recommend you get a full breast examination from your doctor who will advice properly.

Other causes of painful urination (depending on your gender) includes; 
prostatitis - inflammation of the prostate gland.
sexually transmitted infection (STIs) such as genital herpes, gonorrhea, or chlamydia.
kidney stones have also been known to cause painful urination.

I understand your fears and worries. 
It''s only normal you have them. 
However, there has been some instances where we have children whose teeth don''t come out early.

Also, the teeth may not be fully out through the gum pads yet but I''m  sure there''ll be signs that the teeth are present and on their way out. A dentist knows this.
That''s probably why the last dentist you saw said you shouldn''t worry.
However, if you still don''t feel comfortable with that, please feel free to  get a second opinion at another clinic.
See another dentist.
It all boils down to having a thorough  examination carried out on your baby.

Your baby''s teeth should erupt fully into his or her mouth in a couple of weeks though, if there''s  nothing stopping them from coming out.

Kind regards.

There are a number of requirements before one qualifies for a VBAC. First of all, the reason for the first CS should not be a recurrent one. For instance, if the reason for the first CS was a small pelvis, there’s no point trying for a VBAC. 
The duration between the date of your last CS and the date of conception of this pregnancy should not be less than 15 months because this increases the risk of a ruptured uterus. 
Following your CS if there was any infection of the womb or of the wound, it reduces the quality of the CS scar and a repeat CS would be advisable. 
At 36 weeks of pregnancy, your doctor will ask you to do a scan to measure baby’s weight and thickness of the CS Scar, An X-ray or CT Scan of the pelvis will also be done to see if it is adequate. If all these parameters are okay you can then be scheduled for a VBAC. 
It is important to note that in most centers, you will be given a grace till 41weeks and 3 days to come in natural labor because induction of labor is not done routinely in women with previous CS.

Also, the timing for VBAC also depends on many factors.

I guess you are referring to the use of face masks during this COVID-19 pandemic. 
Face masks can be worn if:
- You are coughing or sneezing
- You are taking care if anyone who’s suspected to have the COVID-19 infection

Face masks are not necessary if:
- You are a healthy person with no respiratory symptoms like coughing or sneezing
- You are not in contact with or exposed to a suspected case of COVID-19

If you do have to wear a face mask however it is important to:
- Know how to wear it properly and how to dispose of it
- Combine wearing with proper hand hygiene by cleaning your hands with an alcohol-based hand sanitiser or with soap and water; before and after using the mask
- Avoid touching the mask while you have it on.

We have articles on what you can do to keep safe during this period here on our website.

And we have just launched a tool to help determine if you are at risk which you can access on covid19.wellvis.org

The cause of skin tags varies. It could be hormonal, skin-rubbing-on-skin (like the armpit), viral or genetic.
However they’re usually not harmful nor contagious.
Remedies include:
- Just ignoring it and living with it
- Letting them fall off on their own
- Surgical removal by a professional

It’s worthwhile to ensure that the skin tag is confirmed by your doctor or dermatologist (if available) to ensure it’s not another growth.

Sorry about your experience.
Was the blood you a similar colour with your menstrual blood? Sometimes there could be spotting before the menstrual cycle. Also, uterine fibroids are also known to cause irregular bleeding and well as severe cramping.

My recommendation will be that you visit a gynaecologist to get appropriate care.

Sorry about what you’re experiencing.

When you say weakness do you mean exhausted like after doing exercise or unable to move at all?
Is your wife your first sexual partner?

Usually, after orgasm and ejaculation, there’s a timeframe called the refractory period. During that period, you may feel a little tired from sexual activity and “lazy”. However, that should not stop you from carrying daily activities. 

Some possible causes are:
- Being tired before getting into the activity. That could’ve compounded with the energy spent during intercourse.
- Maybe thé sexual activity was too vigorous. Consider slowing down and you should derive the same pleasure.
- You could be stressed and just need a good rest rather than sex at the time.

If you are getting tired to the extent of not being able to do basic movements like walking, then you should see your doctor for a check up. 

We offer a live chat service here where you can communicate directly with one of our doctors. The service is quite affordable and you are guaranteed to get the best help you need and a referral if needed.

First, I must say taking a drug without indication for it or a doctor''s prescription is not encouraged. 
That said, I suppose you took chloroquine as a measure against covid-19. Chloroquine has not been found to provide protection against the virus or as a sole cure of the virus. At best, it has only been used as part of treatment therapy so there really isn''t any reason to abuse the drug in panic.
Also, your symptom does not suggest you have the virus. Many things could cause the headache like 
Not sleeping well
Stress (even from travelling) etc

So I would that you observe to eat well and rest. 
Also practice high hygiene and social distancing. If you notice any or more symptoms, kindly reach out.

Firstly,  dentists really do not like to take out a tooth that can be saved.
Secondly, It''s actually for your safety that you''ve been told to return for the "filling".
At this stage, from the little history I''ve gathered, you''ll  most likely need  a somewhat complex  treatment to fix the issue.

 Now,because of the Corona Pandemic,  dentists are being careful to drill a tooth and carry out elective procedures 
 because we are at the forefront, we deal with aerosols and this can help spread droplets,  leading to infection of the patient and even the dentist& Nurse.  However,  dental emergencies such as yours are being attended to. 
So you could go back to the clinic or check somewhere else and ask for a temporary  filling that won''t  require drilling to give some form of relief.
Medications may not help so much  until the problem  is sorted. Then meds will be given. 

Ethically wise, in medicine, I''m  not allowed to prescribe  any meds without physical contact with the patient so my best advise still remains that you go back to that clinic or check another clinic that''s  still open. 

I hope this helps and that you take  action fast so you can feel better soon.

Sorry about your concern.

Weight gain, just like weight loss, is a also a challenge for some.

Before I go further, please ensure you have no medical condition that’s responsible for your inability to gain weight. That will need to be addressed first with a doctor.

You can gain weight healthily and gradually. You just need consistency and patience. A few tips I will give are:

- Eating slightly more calories than you do. This doesn’t have to be junk food but healthy foods which are feeling and which you like. Preferably protein and healthy carbohydrates. 

- Consider snacking in between meals. This may also include healthy food options without compromising your overall health.

- Take up weightlifting exercises. This could be body weight exercises like squats and lunges at home or using equipment in your local gym. These will help bulk up your muscle mass and your weight in total.

- Another tip, which you may consider, is just loving yourself as you are. Our body sizes are related to our genetics too. So if that’s your genetic makeup, you could chose to just embrace it and enjoy every moment. But that’s purely your decision, as long as you’re happy with it.

Sorry about your symptoms.

For your first concern; Mucus in stool can be normal or abnormal. It’s usually abnormal when it occurs very often. Do you have any diarrhoea or constipation? Was there any blood in your stool? What has your diet been like prior to the onset of these symptoms? Do you have any other symptoms?
These questions will help guide us to know what may be wrong. Abnormal presence of mucus in stool may be from inflammation, infection, irritation etc. So it’ll be worthwhile visiting your nearest hospital and doing the relevant tests like a stool analysis amongst others. So please do not be panicked until you have been properly examined and investigated by the relevant health professional.

Talking about your second worry, the issue of your missed period, I will ask you to also, please, remain calm. Amenorrhoea (absence of menses) can be due to several other causes other than pregnancy. Some of these include stress, hormonal imbalances, etc. This can be fully explored by visiting your gynaecologist who should offer you the necessary examination and management.

You can log on to the live chat below and communicate directly with one of our doctors who may be able to recommend a doctor/health facility close to you. All this at an affordable charge.

I hope this helps and get better soon', 272, 1215, 0, null, 0, '2020-04-05 11:59:27', '2020-04-05 11:59:27', null);

Erectile dysfunction is men like your husband, above the age of 50 is quite common even more so in men with underlying conditions like diabetes. Long standing diabetes cause damages to nerves, vessels and muscles over time especially in people with poor blood sugar control and all together this can affect their erection. 

Does he have trouble getting an erection or in keeping one? Is there a reduced sexual desire? 

Treatment depends on the general health status of the man, compliance with his mediations, presence of other chronic illnesses such as heart diseases and also ability to tolerate medications. My advice therefore will be that you seek a physician’s examination and subsequent treatment or you can chat a doctor privately for advice by using the chat option.

- Stop smoking and limit or cut out alcohol
- Lose excess pounds and include physical activity in your daily routine

I can relate with what you’re experiencing because I’m on that journey myself and it’s quite a challenge but fulfilling. I’ve knocked off almost 30kg and hoping to lose more.

There’s a lot of good advice out there on how to go about weight loss but what I think shows the most success is making it a lifestyle change. This means Making healthy food choices and choosing a sustainable exercise regimen. These need to be things you love and can keep up without getting bored.

But it’s also important to ensure that your excess weight is not due to any medical condition as it will require more than diet and exercise.

I will recommend the following:
- That you reduce/cut out any processed foods and do more of fresh meals. So say bye to any fast foods and make an effort to cook your own meals.
- Reducing sugar alone or sugar containing products is proven to show some reduction in weight. 
- Reduce your portions gradually and take a lot of water. Sometimes we think we are hungry and all we need to do is drink water.
- While indoors, there are so many video resources and apps for home workouts. You can start with a low intensity workout routine and gradually work your way up to a higher intensity.

These recommendations are a few of many and we will be glad to give you more through the live chat. 

You can do it and hopefully you will do it.

First of all, it is important to establish a few things with you about the hymen. It is a thin piece of tissue that surrounds the vagina, not quite covering it as most people believe. It might interest you to know that some people are born without a hymen and that the hymen usually gets thinner as you grow.

While, like you have pointed out, some cultures use the presence of the hymen as a determinant for virginity; it is important for you to know that simple activities like riding a bicycle or climbing trees can be responsible for hymenal tearing. Basically, the presence or absence of a hymen does not imply sexual activity.
The hymen may bleed when it tears but that does not always happen. 

It is understandable that your fears are grounded in your cultural beliefs, however, it is important to try to engage parents/family members with discussions such as why hymenal tearing is not linked to sexual activity. Please try to be tactful with this conversation or otherwise avoid it if your parents/guardians may physically assault you.

It is also important to, when you get in a relationship, have this kind of conversation with your partner. Please be open about your sexual activity with them too.

As you have mentioned that you have never engaged in sexual activity prior to this, kindly ensure to use protection (i.e. condoms) to keep yourself from sexually transmitted infections.

On a final note, your religion or culture may frown at masturbation but your personal inclinations might be otherwise. In that case, please be careful about the kind of objects you use for your pleasure. Avoid objects with sharp or pointy ends or not at all made for the purpose of masturbation. You can use your fingers but ensure they are clean and your nails are trimmed.

Please stay safe in this pandemic.
Kind regards.', 207, 1250, 0, null, 0, '2020-04-16 11:27:07', '2020-04-16 11:27:07', null);

It’s understandable that you feel stressed now, given your hopes regarding your sexuality.
A virgin is someone who has never had sexual intercourse; however, virginity is beginning to mean different things to different people. The hymen is a membranous lining found at the vaginal opening, it may take different forms and could be absent in some women. It can ‘break’ through various means and may even stretch out over time. You may notice some blood at the point when the hymen is broken.

Please note that for most, the ‘traditional’ meaning of virginity still obtains, which is the absence of peno-vaginal/peno-anal sexual intercourse. Going by this, you are still a virgin.

However, while masturbating might not result in a hymen breaking, I will advise that you visit a hospital close to you, so that your vaginal area can be examined by a nurse or doctor, who will check if your hymen is still intact.
 
I hope this allays your fears. I’m also happy to have a private chat with you, if you wish.

Body odour occurs from the action of part of the body’s normal flora on sweat. Body odour is common and may be associated with excessive sweating. Things that can make body odour worse include poor personal hygiene, exercise, hot weather, being overweight, hormonal changes, certain medications and the presence of medical conditions like diabetes, liver and kidney disease.

Some tips include the following: 
Have your bathe at least twice daily, increase the frequency if you have been involved in particularly rigorous activity. 
Pay attention to your armpit, groin and feet and be sure to towel-dry thoroughly. Take a shower after exercising. 
Shave your armpit regularly. 
Change and wash your clothes regularly. 
Reduce intake of certain foods that have strong smells like garlic, onion, curry as their intake might increase body odour that results from some of your sweat glands. Also, reduce the intake of caffeine and alcohol-containing drinks as they might contribute to body odour.
Maintain a healthy weight for your height. 
Use deodorants.

This sounds like a case of chronic back pain. The history and physical examination are the first step in the evaluation and management of low back pain, therefore you might have to see an orthopaedic surgeon and/or a physiotherapist to rule out serious conditions. 

Meanwhile, you can keep your back healthy and strong by engaging in regular low-impact exercises, that don''t strain your back. It can increase strength and endurance in your back and allow your muscles to function better. Walking and swimming are good choices, this also allows you to build abdominal and back muscles, which strengthen your core, to serve as a natural corset for your back.
You must also maintain a healthy weight, as being overweight strains back muscles. If you''re overweight, trimming down can prevent back pain.
Quit smoking, if you presently smoke. 

Standing, sitting and lifting heavy object in a more back-protective way, will go a long way towards protecting your back.

Sorry about what you are experiencing and I hope I can provide some good counsel.

What you have described sounds like a posterior fourchette (frenulum) injury which could likely be a fissure or tear. Just as you described, it can result from sexual intercourse and in some instances inflammation or infection. Though this tends to resolve after some time (as you mentioned) it can be recurrent too like your case. 

My recommendation will be halting sexual intercourse to allow some healing and while you do that, visit a gynaecologist to examine the affected area. A decision on what is the right treatment can then be done. It could require surgical repair or not depending on the extent of the damage.

If and when you return to sexual intercourse, I will recommend that you and your partner discuss about this so that you both enjoy the experience. His thrustings should be gentle and not vigorous. Also consider assuming positions that do not make penetration challenging. Using lubricants can also offer some benefits.

Good morning. Sorry to read about your pain. There are other questions you need to answer for more clarity.

How long have you been having the pain?
Any history of trauma or accident to the back in the past?

You might be suffering from low back pain which can radiate down to both legs or one leg.  There are several causes of low back pain  and notable among them is a muscle or ligament strain in the back. Another is arthritis of the bones of the back; it can also be due to a bulging disk that could be causing some nerve compression. 
I advise you to make out time to see a doctor for proper evaluation and investigation ( x-ray of the back). In the meantime, you can take some analgesics like paracetamol to ease the pain. Get ergonomically designed seats for use, if your bed is too soft, you can change it. 

I hope this helps.

Good morning. I hope that you are doing great. As regards to your question, If you feel hungry and pain in your navel, it might just be hunger pangs which can be sorted out by having your meals and can be prevented by having regular meals. 

Other questions that you need to answer include but are not limited to:
Is this a first-time pain? 
Has it always been there?
Is there any swelling on your abdomen?
Any pains while urinating?

Vaginal discharge may be normal or abnormal.

Normal causes of vaginal discharge include pregnancy, ovulation, exercise etc. The abnormal causes could be by bacteria, yeast and other organisms (pathogens). Cancer of the cervix (opening of the womb) may also cause vaginal discharge. 

This means that no vaginal discharge should be taken to be ordinary until the doctor says so.

Each cause of vaginal discharge can be differentiated by it''s distinctive colour or smell. A note of it''s consistency should also be noted.

However the description you gave of the vaginal discharge (with respect to it''s colour and odour) shows it is most likely an abnormal vaginal discharge.

More details about the discharge is therefore required from you. 

This would aid in identifying the cause and the appropriate treatment to apply.

Welcome to Wellvis. 

This question is a very common one by young women most especially after childbirth. They are usually bothered about reduced sexual satisfaction for them and their partner.

There are different ways of tightening the vagina but it is worthy of note that, drugs and herbal extracts being advertised everywhere for vaginal tightening does not have a scientific basis for its cure but may even cause more damage to the body.

The most reliable remedy for vaginal tightening is Kegels exercises.

Kegels are actually effective for toning the pelvic floor, decreasing incontinence and improving sexual satisfaction.

Kegel exercises involve tightening the muscles of your pelvic floor in several sets of repetitions throughout the day. 

These are the same muscles you would use to stop urine flow. If you do Kegels, you will improve the strength and tone of your pelvic floor (whether or not you take vaginal tightening pills). 

Finally there are surgical procedures to improve vagina tightness but these are usually used as the last resort.

Hope this helps.', 1288, 1318, 0, null, 0, '2020-05-23 06:21:03', '2020-05-23 06:21:03', null);

It''s not uncommon for women to experience unusual vaginal discharge. The description you have given above may suggest a yeast infection, but with the abnormal odour one will need to clarify a few more details. The good news is that they are treatable.

Meanwhile, its helpful to share overuse of antibiotics and vaginal douching can predispose to the overgrowth of abnormal organisms in the vagina. This is because these practices disrupt the normal protective environment in the vagina.

Thanks for reaching us.

Cytotec (misoprostol) is a drug used for induction of labour but can be prescribed and used by a doctor for medical termination of pregnancy.

In Nigeria, termination of pregnancy is criminal except when performed by a doctor when the health and life of the mother is at risk( if the pregnancy is allowed to continue). Another reason for medical termination of pregnancy is when the baby is malformed in the womb.

In your question, you didn''t tell us if the cytotec you used was prescribed by a doctor or not and for which reason.

Furthermore, the feeling of weakness you experienced could be from excessive blood loss leading to anemia(low blood levels).

Please see a doctor for further evaluation and treatment.

Thanks for your question.
Menses could be delayed for a number of reasons including stress, hormonal issues and so on. While cycle lengths can range from 21 to 35 days, it appears that you are quite familiar your own cycle length.

Since have noticed spots of blood, this may be an indication of your menses resuming or possibly of what is called implantation bleeding. This bleeding often occurs 7-14 days after conception as the fertilized egg gets attached to the wall of the uterus. Other things to consider will be possible infections or use of contraceptives.

However, the easiest thing for you to do at this point will be to do urine pregnancy in the morning.

Sorry about what you are experiencing.

How long have you had this for? How often do you pass stool? Are you experiencing any bleeding when passing stool? What is the consistency of your stool? Do you have to strain when passing stool? Do you sit on the toilet for too long?

Haemorrhoids are usually easy to manage at home. However, you should visit the doctor if it starts bleeding, you notice changes in your stool colour and consistency; as well as other symptoms like dizziness which may be linked to blood loss from the bleeding haemorrhoid.

Some lifestyle modifications will be:
- Eating high fibre foods like fruits which will make passage of stool easier and reduce your chances of being constipated; this will also help avoid straining
- Exercising or being active helps with bowel movements and thus reduces the chances of constipation
- Drink a lot of water and fluids
- Avoid sitting in the toilet for long as this puts pressure on the veins responsible for forming haemorrhoids. Maybe try avoiding the use of your mobile phone while you are using the toilet, as this is a common reason for prolonged toilet use.
- Avoid lifting heavy weights

For treatment:
- Immerse your anal region in warm water for 10-15 minutes two to three times a day using sitz bath, bath tub or a large basin, depending on what is available
- Some creams or ointments, like Anusol, can offer some relief
- You can take oral painkillers. But remember, to see your doctor as the pain worsens.

You should be able to experience some relief and improvement of symptoms with these recommendations.

You can continue this discussion by using the chat function below and one of our doctors will be available to have a live feedback.

Child abuse and molestation is an offence viewed from different perspectives in different countries especially on the basis of the age. Usually, the older child (usually a teenager) is the culprit or initiator, but the there is usually an underlying reason why they indulge in this behaviour. Some countries treat it as a crime while others do not.

However, my advice will be to get the children to a child psychotherapist or counselor so as to curtail the chances of this recurring. Also, providing them with a healthy environment at home will have a great impact; this you can do by continually engaging them in daily home activities and, making sure those living with them and the media (cartoons, movies) they consume have a positive influence.

Sorry to hear about your struggles with vaginal infections.

There are several types of possible infections eg vaginal candidiasis (yeast infection), bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas, pelvic inflammatory disease. Often times, there may be coexistence of more than one

The treatments will differ depending on the specific diagnosis and in some cases the sexual partner also needs to be treated to prevent re-infection.

Some women are also in the practice of washing out their vagina with soap and water. Unfortunately this may  predispose certain vaginal infections by disrupting the normal protective environment

Congratulations on your pregnancy. What is visualized in a pregnancy scan depends, among other things, on the type of ultrasound done. A transvaginal scan (TVS) is done through the vagina and is usually able to have a closer look at pelvic structures, as is seen during a early pregnancy. A transabdominal scan (TAS) is done by placing the ultrasound probe on the abdomen to view structures. In order to help get a better view of pelvic structures in transabdominal scan, you may be asked to have a full bladder (drink lots of water, get pressed but do not urinate)

In a transvaginal scan, it is possible to see a yolk sac within the gestational at about 5 and a half weeks, while it may be around 7 weeks for a transabdominal scan. So again, it will be important to know the type of scan that you had done.

Again, because most of the estimates are also based statistics, it is important to note that one can not be hard and fast on these dates.
My suggestion will be that you consider repeating an ultrasound in about 2 weeks from the previous. 

In the meantime, it will be good to ensure you are registered in a facility that can provide you with optimum antenatal services. Should you notice any bleed, do not hesitate to present to your primary care provider. We will also be glad to answer any other questions or concerns you may have.

You need not worry if you have no other complaints, however you can visit another facility for a repeat ultrasound but I will advice you wait for some time, maybe a week or two and then repeat the ultrasound scan.

Thank you for using Wellvis. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are broadly classified into ''upper tract'' and ''''lower tract'' UTIs. The lower tract involves the bladder and the urethra while the upper tract involves the kidneys and ureters. Treatment options and duration differ based on the specific type of UTI. A few more specific questions can help tease out the type you may have.

It is also important not just to treat a urinary tract infection but to also endeavour to know what predisposed the person to it in order to prevent future recurrences. 

Women are generally more easily predisposed to UTI''s because the urethra in women is relatively short. Some of the factors that may predispose men to UTIs include- poor urine outflow from prostate enlargement or urethral strictures, urinary tract stones or sexually transmitted infections.

Thank you for your question. A ketogenic diet (keto diet for short) is a low carbohydrate, high fat fat diet. Normally, the body uses carbohydrate as fuel for energy. When the body is deprived of carbohydrate, it is forced to burn fat as fuel and in the process release ketone bodies which the cells now use for energy. Because fat is being burned as the primary source of fuel, this diet promotes weight loss.

Keto diet was originally developed to help with children with seizure disorders close to a century ago. It has been thought to be helpful in a number of other health conditions but more research is still needed to ascertain these.
However, it is also important to realize that it is not without its side effects. The ketone bodies have a tendency to make the body more acidic (acidosis). There is also a risk of development of kidney stones. Other possible side effects are fatigue, headache, low blood sugar, indigestion etc.

So if you are considering starting a ketogenic diet, please discuss with your doctor first especially if you have any underlying health condition. It will also be helpful that you undergo this under the guidance of a registered dietitian.

It is important to realize that while loosing weight is important for your health, you should also do it a way that promotes your overall well being.

Should you want further counselling on weight loss, please consider the private chat option with any of our doctors.

The Urinary Tract is composed of the upper (the kidneys and ureter) and lower (the bladder and urethra) segments and discomfort, pain or discharge affecting the lower segment can be indicative of a problem in this region.

while it is possible to recurrent boils in the anal region, what you have described sounds a bit more like a condition called ''fistula-in-ano'' or ''anal fistula''. In anal fistulas, there is usually a tunnel that opens on two sides- one near skin and another near the end of your bowel. Often times, people notice only the outer opening but are unable to see the one that is deeper within anus. Because it is a tunnel with 2  openings, no amount of antibiotics will likely close it.

Thank you for sharing your concerns.
While it is possible for pelvic infections to cause irregular menses, it is usually not from Candida. I am also a bit concerned that you have been on treatment for Candida since the beginning of the year. That''s quite a long time as the treatments usually have specified course and duration.  There are certainly several other types of pelvic infections aside candida. It will be useful t help you explore these.
Having said that, infections are certainly not the only reasons people may experience irregularities in menses. Stress of any kind (physical, psychological etc), hormonal changes, weight changes are just some of the other possibilities. I also hope you have done a pregnancy test?

If you blood pressure is consistently within the range of 140-145mmHg, then it is obvious that you are have high blood pressure. 

The next steps now will be to speak to a family physician, who will examine you and also request some tests in a bid to know exactly what the cause is. Once this has been identified, you will be advised on ways to reduce and stabilise it through lifestyle modifications, however, you might also be prescribed some medications to help control it, if required.

sorry about how you are feeling, you most likely have some sort of infection of the upper part of your respiratory tract.  Nothing here says you have either of malaria or typhoid.

Seizures are an emergency sign in children and the child needs to be seen by a doctor. They usually arise from different conditions which could be metabolic (like low blood sugar), infectious (like malaria or meningitis), chronic illnesses (like epilepsy) or others (like trauma)

Depending on what is causing the seizure, that will determine the treatment. Some treatments do not require anticonvulsants but treatment of the underlying condition (like giving glucose in low blood sugar). Some treatments may have to be life long to improve the quality of life (in conditions like epilepsy).

It is also important if the child is having recurrent seizures to identify any triggers (like flashing lights, loud noise, hunger, etc) as well as any factors or conditions related to the seizures. Another thing to note is to keep the child away from a harmful environment like flames, stairs and being unattended (depending on the age).

• If you have any health condition or not after examination by the designated health personnel
• Any medical tests you may have performed
• Any management or treatments you may need; as well as any recommendation for further treatment or care outside the hospital providing the report.

What you are experiencing is normal and I implore you not to feel embarrassed about it. You are having wet dreams which happens to almost every man, and could be more frequent with others. They are called wet dreams because of the ejaculation that occurs, usually after an erotic dream.

Your sexual attraction towards the opposite sex too is normal but you will need to learn to control your urges so the lady does not feel harrassed. 

You can try and have discussions that are less erotic or sexually suggestive. 

You can also try to meet her in the midst of others or in public, so as to avoid resorting to any behaviour she may find inappropriate. 

Depending on your cultural or spiritual beliefs, you could consider indulging in masturbation to ease the built up sexual tension.

The issue of sleep disorders in the elderly is very broad, as causes vary significantly. Understanding the exact cause can sometimes be time consuming but the results are always worth it. 

Considering it is a long standing issue as stated by you, it is important that she gets a general health review preferably from a physician or a geriatrician, which will include understanding her medical history, concomitant medications she may be on, physical examination, lab tests etc. A mental status examination will also be required to rule out underlying psychological stress or disorders following retirement, existing health problems, death of loved ones etc. 

Also, she might be required to keep a sleep diary and a sleep study may be requested. 

Overall, it is important that the underlying issue be identified as soon as possible and any accompanying illness be treated or managed. Over the counter sleep medications can become abused, or not work as before once tolerance is built and most importantly can have adverse effect when used with some other medications. 

Pending her review with a family physician, some helpful tips include; 
limiting liquid before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, eating three to four hours before bedtime, light exercising regularly, taking a warm bath to relax etc.

Sorry about what you’re experiencing.

I would love to know if you’ve ever had an endoscopy done before. This will help confirm what may be causing these prolonged symptoms by means of visualising your digestive tract.

I empathise with what your son is going through and hopefully my response here offers some help.

Did he use a common blade at the barber’s shop? Is this the first time it’s happening? Have you noticed any bumps on his head?

What you have described sounds like folliculitis, sometimes called Barber’s itch. It is an infection of the hair follicles usually from poorly sterilised shaving equipment. The infection could be from bacteria, fungi or viruses in some cases. It normally resolves in about two weeks with just home management. However if poorly treated, could have complications.

I’ll recommend you wash his head and put a warm moist cloth or towel over it after that. Depending on the causative organism, you can apply an antibacterial or antifungal cream or ointment.

To prevent this from recurring, consider purchasing hair clippers for his personal use. If this cannot be done, ensure that the barber cleans and sterilises his machine properly before using on his head.

You can use the chat function below and get in touch with one of our doctors. With the chat you can take photos of the hair and scalp, and send to give a clear idea of what is going on.

The feeling of numbness and tingling in the hands and legs is known as paresthesia and because it’s been going on for about two years, this is considered chronic paresthesia, which is often a sign of nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy). 

There are different causes of peripheral neuropathy; diabetes, kidney disease, infections, poisoning etc. are some of the known causes. 

The severity and frequency of the paresthesia depends on the cause, therefore it is important to find the exact cause, oftentimes treating the underlying cause eliminates the continuous numbness and tingling sensation. The earlier the underlying cause is identified and management commenced, the less likely potentially lifelong consequences can develop.

Sorry about the aesthetic discomfort you’re experiencing and hopefully my reply can offer you some reassurance.

From your description of the event, it appears that your body healed itself by hypertrophy (swelling). Unfortunately, it cannot be modified by application of creams or ointments as it now functions as a normal part of your body. Which leaves the only possible solution, I’m aware of, to be surgical correction by a plastic surgeon.

However, if I may ask further, are you experiencing any physical discomfort like pain, difficulty talking, eating etc? Also, are you getting teased, mocked or made fun of? If yes, you should see a doctor to assess the implications the physical impediment. And for the social stigma, if this is happening within a formal setting (school or work) inform the relevant authority.

I’ll encourage you to talk about it with someone you trust, a family member or a friend.  That may help you be much more comfortable with it and may in turn inspire someone else who faces the same. You’ve done a great job living with it for 6 years and my guess is your immediate circle of interaction do not see you as any different than before the incident.

Sorry about this ordeal.

Depending on your location, the formalities may differ but the approach is usually the same. The main things I’ll recommend will be:

-  The victim should report to the police station so that the chase for the perpetrator is initiated. 

- Visit thé hospital for examination of the genital and anal areas to document any signs of forced entry. Here also, a screen for sexually transmitted infections needs to be done. 

- For female victims, abortion services may be offered (depending on local laws). Since it’s been 2 weeks, the emergency contraceptive pill will be of no benefit.

- Counseling and therapy sessions need to be started for the victim to mitigate the mental health effects of the rape. You can look up institutions or organisations focused on rape in your area and contact them.

- At thé family and community level, moral support should be provided to the victim. Keeping the victim’s name undisclosed is important in avoiding stigmatization.

Thanks for your question.

Kindly note that that no matter what you have heard, read or previously known Andrew Livers salt is not effective or useful, and will never be useful for emergency contraception, as that is not what the manufacturers intended it be used for.

It is a misconception that Andrews Liver salt can prevent pregnancy.

Which of the arms is affected?

Are you hypertensive or diabetic?

Are you on any medications?

Answers to some of these questions can give some clue. I suggest that you private chat a doctor for a detailed history and examination.

Your fertile period which is also known as ovulation period can be identified by the following signs:
Common Signs that Occur in Most Women
- Change in cervical fluid – the Cervical fluid that resembles “egg whites” is a sign you are near ovulation or are ovulating. 
- Change in basal body temperature – Your body temperature suddenly rises around the period. Tracking your basal body temperature accurately over a few months can help you predict fertile period.
- Breast tenderness
- Abdominal bloating
- Increased sex drive
- A heightened sense of smell, taste or vision.

You can also go online and use a web based ovulator calculator.

You seem to have reached a conclusion on being addicted to sex, was this a diagnosis given by a doctor or you only believe that you are addicted to sex based on your urges and cravings ?

Meanwhile, I do not know how easy it will be to ask the lady to go get tested against her will, therefore that might be a dead end. 
My advice is that you visit a clinic for voluntary HIV counselling and testing, and to continue to practice safe sex if you are unable to abstain completely.

Also known as mouth odor,halitosis could be an embarassing condition to the sufferer and the diagnosis can be quite tricky to the dentist.It can be classified into, True halitosis  and Psychogenic halitosis(false halitosis in which the person just feels he has mouth odor even when nobody has ever told him his mouth was smelling).
Having said that,there are  a couple of likely causes of true halitosis and these determine the chronicity of the condition.Some of the possible causes include:
1.Poor oral hygiene-A heavy presence of plaque and calculus(yellowish to dark colored deposits on the teeth) in the mouth will cause mouth odor.Also, non-brushing or improper brushing of the tongue is a major cause of halitosis.The tongue is the largest reservoir of food debris in the mouth hence, not brushing the tongue is like not brushing at all.
2.Diets: Frequent concsumption of onions,garlic,beans and other food which produce Volatile sulphur compounds(VSC).These VSCs play a major role in diet-asociated halitosis.
3.Systemic diseases like Chronic Kidney disease,Gastroesophageal reflux disorders(GERD) can also cause halitosis.
Also,halitosis is associated with eating disorders like Bulimia nervosa, where people engage in acts of  intentionally inducing vomitting of food ingested.Besides some people engage in the habit of regurgitating ingested food and this could also lead to mouth odor.

Based on all I  have stated above,the best way to diagnose halitosis would be for you to visit a dentist.The dentist will have to examine your mouth thoroughly and evaluate the possible causes of the halitosis in your case.
Have you ever had scaling and polishing ? It is very possible the chronic halitosis in your case is because you have never visited the dentist.Scaling and polishing is a procedure which is meant to be done every six months  at least,and this is a way to clear the "cobwebs" in our mouths(the plaque and calculus which I mentioned earlier).

Bloating is usually caused by excess gas in the stomach due to your diet or based on disturbances in the movement along the digestive system. Considering it’s been present for over a year I doubt it’s anything too serious. However, it is important to ask about your dietary history, presence of abdominal pain or any other associated symptoms such as duration and frequency of passing gas and bowel movements; characteristics of your stool, presence of blood in your stool, weight loss, if it’s worsened by a particular meal or not etc. 

Meanwhile, some way to reduce the associated discomfort in bloating are as follows; don’t eat large quantity of food at once or gassy foods.

Good morning. Ideally one should not see blood during sex. It is not normal. However, there are a couple of possibilities as to why this can be happening. 
First is there is the possibility of a sexually transmitted infection going on. Then it can also be what we call a cervical polyps. Most commonly, cases of vaginal dryness. If there is poor lubrication before penetration, it can lead to painful sex, bruising and subsequently bleeding. 

Then bleeding can also be due to cervical cancer.

Most importantly, you should do a pelvic ultrasound scan. This will reveal if there is any retained products or a live gestational sac.

Any period that lasts beyond the normal days is abnormal. The fact that you don''t feel pain doesn''t mean you should ignore it. Something sinister may just be going on in there.

I''m going to ask you some follow up questions to have a better understanding of what''s going on.
Have they ever been bed wetting or did they have a period of dryness then began to bedwet again? Are they on medication for any condition? During the day do they contain themselves well?
It''s important to see a doctor so as to have them examined and if need be, run some tests to exclude the possibility of infections and other underlying conditions that might lead to the bedwetting. 
Meanwhile keep an otimistic attitude and motivate them. Don''t let them feel bad about it or punish them.
Encourage them to void when they wake up, every few hours (say 2hrs) and discourage them from holding urine to the last minute. 
They should drink just enough fluids throughout the day so as to maintain adequate hydration as well as not feel thirsty in the evening, which could lead them to drink excessive amounts before bed and bedwetting.
Take them to the washroom before bedtime. If after 3 months these measures don''t result in dryness, medication or using an alarm at night will help.

Sorry about baby. It was a good call to have him reviewed by an ophalmologist as the treatment will depend on what is discovered during the assessment of the affected eye(s) as well as tests done.
If the squint is of sudden onset, it could point to causes like a recent disease process e.g infections. A longstanding squint could be as a result of e.g developmental abnormalities of the eye muscles and it''s nerves or diseases that weaken the eye muscles among others.
The ophthalmologist therefore has to assess the baby''s vision to see if it''s reduced or not, his eye movements to assess the strength of the eye muscles and to even check the inside of the eye (by use of an instrument)
Now the treatment will depend on what''s discovered. If there is an underlying disease causing the squint, whether inside the eye or not, it is the disease that will be treated. If he has decreased vision in the affected eye(s), that will be corrected too. There is also role for surgery, which aims to improve cosmetic appearance and to tighten or loosen the eye muscles.

Body weight is a function of what you eat and how healthy you are. If you are ill, sometimes you won''t gain weight. 
Also if you don''t eat, you won''t gain weight. 

Elementary science teaches us that proteins are body building foods. And we also need to balance out our diets to get adequate nutrition to grow well.

Thanks for using Wellvis. Periods on average vary between 3 - 5 days in most people, anything within that period should not cause any concern.

Whew, it is indeed a long and detailed question. 

So here’s the thing...there are still quite a lot of things not known about COVID, however it’s unlikely you couldn’t smell without noticing it, especially of you didn’t notice any change in your sense of taste. Meanwhile, these complications as you have mentioned are not the most common ones therefore aren’t very common. 
It’s possible for one to get stressed over  one’s exposure or about a lot of these nondescript complaints. 

“Brain complications” is very vague, and although neurological symptoms from COVID exist, they are usually in the form of headaches, confusion and less commonly, stokes. 

My advice really to you is to stop worrying about unlikely brain complications of a disease you don’t even know for a fact if your have/had, however, ensure you continue to wear a mask when out in the public, practice social distancing and maintain hand hygiene.

Some of the most common reasons for frequently clearing the throat include; laryngopharyngeal reflux (usually when stomach contents travel upwards causing a discomfort in the throat) or allergies. Sometimes it could just be due to a tic, which is an uncontrollable reaction.

Females don''t ejaculate. Females have an orgasm. Your partner is probably not doing it right. Your partner needs to locate your clitoris and G-spot to help you have an orgasm.

1. The average time for males to ejaculate is 2 to 5 minutes. However some males have mastered the ability to hold off ejafulation for a while. You don''t have premature ejafulation. 
2. Your erection goes down probably because the condom is too tight. Just as there are different penile sizes, there are also different condom sizes. If you use one that is too tight, it may cut off blood supply to your penis and cause it to shrink. So get an appropriate sized condom. 
3. You can train yourself to last longer before ejaculation by pausing your thrusts when you feel like ejaculating. Pause for few seconds until you feel the urge to ejaculated disappear. Repeat this until you are ready to orgasm. Do this often and you will get used to it.

sorry about your experience. The only way to know if you have COVID is to take a test to confirm, you might just have another kind of regular infection thats quite common.  If you are not getting better as you said it will be a good idea to consult a doctor for what needs to be done and what management you might need.

On the other hand if you feel this is due to exposure to someone with COVID, it will be a good idea to isolate yourself and inform the NDDC to know about next steps.

Difficulty breathing and chest pain are general symptoms that can indicate several things. It could be an issue with your lungs, heart, kidneys, muscles of the chest, ribs and even just your mind.

To have an impression, further questioning will be needed. We can assist you by means of our chat which connects you to a doctor who can explore your complaints and come up with a probable diagnosis.

They could also be indicators of acute medical problems which need immediate medical attention. So if you (or whoever suffers these) are experiencing them and it''s affecting your usual activity, urgently visit the nearest health facility for check up

However, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, difficulty breathing is one of the signs related to severe disease. I recommend you use our online tool to assess your risk by visiting this link: https://covid19.wellvis.org/

Based on your complaints and how common this complaints are, I believe what your are experiencing is heartburn, which is caused by acidic stomach contents coming back up towards the throat (acid reflux). It is often accompanied by an unpleasant sour taste in the mouth. 

Lots of people get heartburn from time to time and sometimes there’s no obvious reason why.
However, it has been shown that certain foods or activities worsen it; 
such as coffee, alcohol, chocolate, beans and fatty or spicy foods, being overweight, smoking, pregnancy, stress and anxiety etc.

Excessive urination has several known causes of which diabetes mellitus (DM) is amongst the most common. From your write up, I am assuming you have excluded DM (by means of a blood glucose test). Thus, it is important to further investigate other causes like infections, diabetes insipidus, medications, bladder and/or prostate issues, conditions causing elevated calcium etc. These can''t all be discussed in this reply because the relevant questions need to be asked which apply to your situation (for example, it won''t be logical to think an infection is the cause for 13 years).

This is just an advice, 
1. Try reducing weight if you are over-weight or obese,because the female breast is made up of specialized tissues that produces milk (glandular tissue) as well as fatty tissue. The amount of fat determines the size of the breast. So if you don''t want a big burst, reduction of weight through diet and exercise can help.
2. If you are on hormonal pills that contain oestrogen,  it will affect the size of your breast because oestrogen hormone influences the breast development causing fat to be deposited in the breast. So l will advice you to avoid oestrogen containing contraceptives.

-Achieve and Maintain a Healthy Weight
-Eat Lots of Fruit and Vegetables

These foods include soybeans and soy products, tofu, tempeh, flaxseeds, linseeds, sesame seeds and beans.
-Drink Enough Water
-Reduce Refined Sugar and Processed Foods
-Don''t Skip Meals: Eating regular meals may be important when you''re going through menopause.

It is not uncommon to see babies with their (umbilical) cord wrapped around their necks. It is not as a result of any cause from the mother and usually does not cause any harm during delivery. It is sometimes but not always associated with excess amniotic fluid or when there is more than one baby in the womb. It is usually loosely wrapped around the neck allowing normal foetal blood flow. 

If detected early, it is not a cause for concern as long as the baby movements can still be felt throughout the pregnancy. During labour, the heart rate and vitals of the baby will be monitored as usual to detect any distress and act accordingly. If it is a normal delivery with the head coming out first, one of things always checked for is if the cord is around the neck. This will be removed first before delivering the rest of the baby''s body.

So it''s important to regular at and report any changes during antenatal visits, as well as making sure delivery occurs in a health facility from skilled hands.

I am assuming by "running stomach" you mean diarrhoea as my reply will be under this assumption.

The treatment of diarrhoea depends on the age of the person affected, the nature of the stool being passed, the possible cause and other factors. In majority of cases, the diarrhoea resolves on its own within a few days without any intervention or treatment

The main aim of treatment is to replenish the electrolytes and fluids being lost by taking water, rehydration solutions, soup but be wary of fruit juice as they can worsen diarrhoea. In severe cases, it may require an IV drip at a health facility.

If the cause is infectious (bacteria or parasites), antibiotics can be taken to treat any infections. Signs like blood in stool are pointers towards a possible infection. However, note that some antibiotics may in fact cause or worsen diarrhoea, so ensure you only take an antibiotic prescribed by a doctor.

Other underlying conditions need to be treated. Consult with your doctor if you are having recurrent episodes of diarrhoea

Avoiding possible triggers or causes like dairy, spicy foods, sugary foods, foods high in fats and fibre, etc, can help prevent onset or worsening of the diarrhoea.

There are various causes of spotting per vagina. And more probing needs to be done to narrow it down. For instance; Have you been on some medication prior to this time?

Has your menstrual pattern been regular?. Any associated pain?.

It is common in some cases to have this kind of experience when trying to have sex for the first time, this could be due to fear of the pain, the possibility of having some form of tissue in place that makes penetration difficult or insufficient stimulation.

What you are seeing could be a normal occurrence in some women, its known that some women during sex release such white substance and in most cases there is nothing to fear.  However, if what you are seeing is smelly or your woman starts to itch or have issues urinating then you might need to have it checked, apart from that there isnt anything to fear.

Apologies for the tardy response and I hope it still benefits you.

Sorry about the symptoms you are experiencing. Keloids can be very discomforting especially when they are itchy (and painful in some cases). This itching is common with keloids, and though much is not understood about them, the itching may be associated to its interactions with nerves within the skin. To remedy this, I will recommend visiting a dermatologist who will advice on any of the available treatments like steroids, surgical removal or others. However, unfortunately, keloids seem to resurface after intervention.

Regarding your second question, I am unsure if you are referring to the affected breast or the keloid. But please know that keloids do not affect the normal function of the breast, to the best of my knowledge. Except maybe it''s impeding suckling in breastfeeding mothers if the keloid is around the nipple.

For a more tailored response, please use the chat function below and one of our verified doctors will be available to assist you further and answer your questions in real time.

I hope this helps', 272, 1719, 0, null, 0, '2021-03-16 17:30:50', '2021-03-16 17:30:50', null);

In some cases, it has been found that carbonated drinks like soft drinks make peptic ulcer worse, might this be the case for you? maybe.

Sorry about what you’re going through. Swollen gums could be due to various issues like infection, inflammation, types of foods you eat (or don’t eat), reactions to some oral hygiene products, just to name a few.

If this is recurrent or lasting too long, I’ll recommend talking with a dental professional and getting checked. While home remedies may provide some relief (or not, as in your case), they don’t take away the root cause.

Congratulations on your new baby. It is a good idea for you to go back for assessment after a few days of discharge for the doctor to examine the site of the C/S and be sure of  how the wound is doing. Also, depending on how long ago was the C/S its normal for you to have some form of pain while the wound is healing, this pain should go away after a while but if it doesnt go away or get worse please go and see the doctor who did the operation.
